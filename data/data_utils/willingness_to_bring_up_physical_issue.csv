;Why or why not?
0;
1;It would depend on the health issue. If there is a health issue that would not immediately affect my job performance, such as diabetes, I would not bring it up during the interview. If it was something more severe, such as narcolepsy, I might bring it up depending on how controlled it was.
2;They would provable need to know, to Judge if I can do my job or not. 
3;old back injury, doesn't cause me many issues but occasionally impacts my ability to work at desk 
4;Depending on the interview stage and whether I required an accommodation, I would
5;If it would potentially affect my ability to do the job or might require special equipment/etc then it would only be fair and honest.
6;I want to gauge their ability to support this issue.
7;I feel it's irrelevant.
8;Makes me a less attractive candidate.
9;Generally speaking, and this isn't always the case, physical health issues don't carry the same stigma as mental ones.
10;Being honest upfront shows respect for the future employer. If they see that as a stumbling block in hiring you, then it probably wouldn't have been a good fit in the long run anyways.
11;It isn't relevant to my ability as a programmer.
12;Seems highly unlikely to be relevant
13;I might have special needs that would be impossible to hide.
14;Because of the potential for discrimination
15;I don't think it's appropriate to discuss those issues during early interviews. I'd wait to discuss with HR after I have a feel for what's going on.
16;
17;
18;
19;Physical impairments aren't traditionally stigmatized. Far less judgements and resulting talk behind backs compared to mental
20;It might affect their opinion of me.
21;I don't have any
22;depends on the illness
23;"Like all interviews, I feel like not putting your ""best foot"" forward puts you at a disadvantage."
24;Only if it would impact my performance to the job.
25;
26;I'm afraid I wouldn't be hired for the job, even when the physical issue would not have been relevant for my work.
27;
28;I'd be wary of them seeing potential time out for appointments etc as a negative
29;I wouldn't want to be judged against someone healthy
30;Depending on the exact nature of the issue I might think they wouldn't want to hire me
31;Seems unnecessary
32;It doesn't have any bearing on my ability to accomplish the job when properly coped with.
33;Completely dependant on the relevance of the mental health issue and it's impact on the work being applied for. 
34;It's good to be upfront about everything.
35;I don't think is the place nor the time for this
36;These days I'm more comfortable expressing anything that could be a factor in getting work done. It helps me screen employers: if anything is an insurmountable problem for them, then it is clearly not a place I want to work.
37;
38;
39;The employer needs to know that I would need support in order to do my best work for them
40;An employer weighs the impact to quality/availability of work and the cost to productivity as well as the cost (in my case) to ensure that I have the proper equipment (I'm obese).  Unfortunately, it's not something that's avoidable for the employer to notice.
41;For me, it depends on how the interview is going - if it's clear that it's a dead end, I would not bring it up.
42;Depends on the social perception of the issue.
43;
44;
45;Seems like it would deter them from hiring me.
46;I would bring up a physical health issue with a prospective employer if I were to find that the job required tasks that I was unable to complete or safely attempt that could cause injury to myself or others. 
47;If the issue would impact my performance without some form of concessions/consideration on the party of the employer, I would, otherwise I wouldn't. 
48;Because I'd want to know if they can provide an ergonomic keyboard, or are happy with a worker plugging their own keyboard into their computers.
49;None of their business
50;
51;
52;simply because it's important for them to be aware of the situation when I would have physical issues.
53;I understand that, while they might consciously not act differently if I had a physical issue, I'm not at all convinced that people in tech, even those who know what Cognitive Dissonance means, will actually take steps to avoid it.
54;Because, if it were a physical health issue that might affect my job performance, it'd be difficult to hide and a potential might resent the fact that I wasn't forthcoming about it in an interview.
55;It's too early - I don't want to discuss potential deal breakers until they've decided they want me. 
56;
57;
58;It would depend on the issue and the employer.
59;I wouldn't want to risk leaving a current job position for one where such things could be an issue.
60;if the physical issue is obvious at work, it's better not to try to hide.
61;If it were relevant to the role I would mention it
62;
63;No because it might not get me the job 
64;Disclosing that cannot help you get the job
65;None of their business.
66;
67;
68;
69;It should not effect they way how I work. So it should not have any negative things for the new boss
70;because it might affect my working hours (visiting doctors etc)
71;To be honest I guess and not to end up with suprises
72;Could only hurt my chances
73;Honesty works.
74;For physical health issues that may not impact my  daily job, I don't feel the need to divulge them to a prospective employer.
75;
77;depends if it is relevant. If it's none of their business, then not.
78;Companies are more equipped to accommodate physical health issues and it looks bad if they don't. 
79;I would prefer be honest and up-front rather than find out the employer is not supportive down the road
80;I wouldn't know whether it would affect my changes of getting the job.
81;I live in a country where they only care about what physicians tell them in a pre-contract exam.
82;Depends if it affected the job
83;If it relates to workspace design (eg, special ergonomic needs) or necessary schedule (eg, can't work for 8 hours straight)
84;
85;If the health issue would not impact my performance, then I may not bring it up. 
86;
87;
88;
89;Because it can be seen as a weakness and they may chose another applicant over me because of it.
90;Only would do it if I would believe it would have impact on my productivity.
91;bias
92;Transparency
93;Starting a job hiding something like this can be a really bad way to get the trust of the employees. 
94;
95;
96;I would be suspicious that it would negatively effect their opinion of me as a potential employee / Bring down the superwoman factor a little.
97;I've never been in a situation like this so it's hard to say. My answer might be different depending on the exact health issue.
98;
99;Unless it impacted my job I wouldn't 
100;"US worker protections are lacking; proving a protected class as reason for non-hire is difficult"
101;"I would expect an unconscious bias against someone whose employment involves extra risk of medical leave, accommodations, or expense. Even an employer with the best intentions might unintentionally favor the ""easier"" hire."
102;If it's relevant to the position 
103;I prefer to use the interview as an opportunity to learn more about a potential employer and to showcase my skills.
104;It _could_ way into being hired, instead of skills
105;Only if it was very relevent would I share such information.  Otherwise no reason to give black marks to myself.
106;if it were serious, I'd worry that it would prevent my being hired
107;If it was a protected disability thing, or if it just came up randomly.  Or if it's not a chronic condition.
108;I imagine that would prompt the interviewers to quickly disregard my resume.
109;If it's relevant, because it would require changes to work hours or something like that, I would bring it up. If not, then it's not relevant in an interview.
110;I am to the point in my career where if I can't be honest with my employer, then I do not want to work for them.
111;?
112;I'd generally be able to cope/work despite physical health issues, but would doubt the interviewer would consider/believe that.  I wouldn't trust them to avoid bias based on health concerns.
114;Depends if it's going to have an impact on that particular job
115;Due to increased healthcare cost potential
116;Depends on the vibe from the interview.
117;
118;depends on the nature of the issue. i think it might bias them to look for reasons not to hire me or expect me to be a sub-par contributer
119;
120;Because I wouldn't want to work for a company who wouldn't support someone with a condition.
121;Depends on the type of job, if it would affect my work, I would bring it up.
122;
123;People take physical illnesses or injuries seriously. You don't have to look a certain way to be believed to have a physical health issue. People can see it so they believe it. They often can't blame you for it or think you're just making it up 
124;Unless it has a direct impact on my job, it's not their business, and I value my privacy.
125;Chronic physical health issues often affect hiring decisions, even though employers won't say so.  I'm diabetic, and have observed this to be true.
126;I would if I got the impression it wouldn't count against me/the interviewer seemed empathetic to that scenario, because that condition might likely mean time away from work to address the issue and I would want to know the policies in place for employees with physical health issues, particularly for chronic illness. 
127;Because it would impact the relationship (there might be adjustments needed to the work space for example) and I believe honesty up front to be the best approach.
128;It has nothing to do with my job skills. My interviewer does not need to know about it. 
129;Depends on what it is. 
130;Afraid of adding something negative to the balance sheet
131;I would bring up a physical health issue only if negotiating from a position of strength, such as having multiple offers or being currently employed in a stable position.
132;It's not a big deal
133;It is not their concern unless it affects my ability to perform my job
134;Would only bring it up if it affected my ability to do the job.
135;Unless it would impact my work, it's nobody's business.  
136;Too personal
137;I figure it should be part of the conversation. They need all the facts before making a call, in the same ways I need to know if they can adjust for me.
138;Because despite all of the laws governing non discrimination, employers will go with what's easiest and come up with a different reason as to why they're not hiring you. Employees are ultimately resources to be leveraged, and companies don't want to get less for their money. 
139;If it were relevant to job performance or required some sort of accommodation on their part
140;Jeopardizes getting the job
141;I don't want health issues to affect how I am represented in an interview.
142;Risk of not getting an offer
143;may not get hired
144;I'm deaf. It'll be obvious soon enough. 
145;Because it's none of their business. 
146;Depends greatly on the job involved.  I can adapt quickly to jobs involving heavy lifting, for example, but would not admit that it would probably wind me to start with.  Most physical health issues severe enough to discuss are visible, and if they are not (say I have cancer and am going to be going on chemo) I would not discuss because of huge possibility of not being hired due to potential for medical leave / lots of absence.  
147;Any health issue is potentially a liability, so I would hesitate to mention it unless it had direct bearing on the job responsibilities.
148;I'm already very private about personal issues
149;
150;
151;It depends on the reputation of the employer
152;Not anyone's business but mine
153;I would bring it up if it was obvious or relevant.
154;If I needed accommodations as part of my work, or if it were very obvious and referring to it might diffuse tension, I would bring it up. Otherwise, I would not.
155;
156;
157;
158;Not their business
159;Risk of losing consideration for a position 
160;My physical health issues are obvious from my appearance.
161;They might think I'm a hypochondriac
162;
163;They may not hire me thinking I might take time off from work. 
164;Generally not applicable to my job
165;
166;Only if it would affect my future work.
167;
168;If it impacts the work, they should know about it.
169;
170;I don't know, I've never had a physical health issue that would need bringing up, so I don't know how I'd react in that situation
171;If it was a long term issue that would require special accommodations on their part.
172;Could impact their willingness to hire, even subconsciously.
173;Would risk not getting the job.
174;
175;I wouldn't want it to affect my ability to get the position
176;
177;I would be afraid it would negatively impact my chances.
178;I would want to make sure expectations were set clearly at the start
179;
180;
181;Depends if it's relevant
182;
183;I have RSI and don't want them to think I'm not worth investing in.
184;I had brain surgery in 1997. Bringing that up is pretty much a no job. On top of that hell they want to look at your DNA first these days. Sad days.
185;They're usually temporary and you know when it'll be gone
186;Concern it could overshadow legit issues
187;Depending on how strong my position as interviewee is, I might prefer to wait until the offer stage rather than bring it up at interview
188;I don't really know. It would depend on my impressions at the time.
189;
190;
191;To avoid not being hired
192;
193;
194;If it would make me seem less suitable for a job
195;I'd want to be honest and up-front with a potential employer.
196;
197;I would feel OK discussing physical health, mainly because it can be diagnosed and corroborated by a doctor.
198;
199;It depends on the nature of the issue and how it may impact my ability to work.
200;I wouldn't bring it up unless absolutely necessary for my day-to-day job function, out of fear of discrimination or not being hired.
201;It's best to be up front about stuff if possible - if the employer is aware, then it is easier to judge their attitude towards it (positive or negative) before accepting a position.
202;
203;Wouldn't want to risk not getting the job - i'd wait until I was hired
204;
205;if it wasn't relevant
206;
207;Wouldn't want that to be counted against me when compared to other candidates.
208;
209;"It might not particularly be seen as a ""good"" thing to bring it up."
210;
211;It would depend on the issue, and whether or not I think it would impact the work I do
212;Depends whether it would affect my ability to carry out the job.
213;
214;If it may affect my productivity, my employer should know about it
215;
216;
217;Yes, Is important if can affect work.
218;Because it might be important for the employer in case it affects my productivity.
219;cos i don't have any physical health problems
220;
221;
222;Only if it would require immediate accommodation.
223;Less chances of getting the job, I think
224;In the interview I'm still trying to present the best image of myself and that may damage it (rightly or wrongly)
225;Unless it's something obvious like I'm disabled
226;I would think they don't care about it
227;It would depend on how relevant it would be. 
228;Because it's common
229;unless it directly affects my ability to do the job, it is irrelevant
230;That should not be a deciding factor when they choose to hire me or not. Why does my physical issue need to be pointed out if its not going to effect my job. 
231;I prefer to keep nothing hidden
232;
233;If it was something that affected my work, yes.
234;Cultural bias and potential elimination from consideration.
235;Honesty, always the best policy, even if it means I don't get the job.
236;because every one should work in an healthy and safe place ...
237;
238;Completely depends upon what the issue would be.
239;It might affect my performance and workplace
240;
241;
242;It affects my work 
243;
244;
245;I'd be concerned that it would negatively affect my employment opportunity.
246;If it looked like you'd take a lot of time off or die soon
247;I wouldn't want to knowingly generate bias against me in an interview.
248;I want to get hired
249;no stigma, high probability of sympathy/understanding
250;I don't require accommodations and I'm afraid of discrimination. 
251;
252;I prefer to keep my health information private as long as it is not actively affecting my job performance at the time of the interview.
253;seems wrong
254;It might make them less likely to hire me, e.g. because of cost of health insurance.
255;Only got ask
256;I worry it would affect my chances of employment.
257;Naturally, I'd be afraid that they wouldn't hire me.
258;
259;I wouldn't feel comfortable discussing my personal health and would not want to appear weak.
260;My interview process involves checking my baggage at the door. If it's someplace I wouldn't feel comfortable bringing that type of thing up after being hired, I don't want to be interviewing there anyway. Trust.
261;
262;despite the fact that the Canadian human rights act forbids discrimination based on mental or physical health, many public sector companies will try to cross the line by asking questions that touch on health as a way to minimize insurance premium costs
263;I've always been coached that it's not appropriate to discuss anything like that, as it may adversely impact the interview.
264;
265;Not risk mot getting the job in case they thought I would be off work more often
266;If I felt it would decrease the odds of getting the position, I'd probably omit the information.
267;Never know how they coudl take it? 
268;I think they would see it as temporary, maybe even view you as hardy/resilient
269;
270;
271;
272;Really depends on the vibe that I got from the interview.
273;Even though not legal, it could be a factor in hiring. Also, none of their business.
274;depends  if  it  would affect my  work
275;Physical health issues are more socially/culturally acceptable and would not reflect as poorly on the interviewee as a mental health issue.
276;Physical issues are relatively well understood by anyone I've ever mentioned them to.
277;
278;Depends on whether it would put me in the position of needing to ask for accommodations.
279;I'd only bring it up in an interview if the issue required accommodation.
280;
281;Personal health issues don't belong in the interview process, as it inherently makes the interview particularly hostile to the interviewee and their organization (because HR law, especially as relating to anti-discrimination, is a thing).
282;I wouldn't want to bring up anything that may trigger unconscious bias and therefore hinder my chances of receiving a job
283;
284;Not relevant
285;It's my problem, not theirs.
286;there's no stigma to saying you have an rsi, a heart condition, etc.
287;If it was something actually relevant to the job I was interviewing for, of course I would bring it up.
288;Fear of discrimination
289;
290;depends if I feel comfortable enough
291;It wouldn't affect day-to-day activities
292;Only if it would affect performance.
293;Not of their business
294;That is none of their business and it would affect their decision regardless of policy
295;
296;If it does not affect my job then it is not their concern
297;Dependent upon impact on work duties.
298;physical health is not always a reason to not being able to work
299;Wouldn't feel comfortable telling them.
300;they might think i'd be a high-maintenance or expensive hire
301;It may affect the hiring managers decision if I bring this up. Although, an interview is about ensuring the employer is a good fit for me too. So I would have to consider my options at the time.
302;
303;Because I'd die if I had to physically work beyond my capacity.
304;It depends on how permanent the issue is likely to be.
305;It wouldn't affect my ability to perform the work, so would be unlikely to affect the outcome of an interview
306;It could affect my application.
307;I don't think i need it
308;Unspoken prejudices
309;My physical health directly impacts my productivity and is a factor I consider in any value proposition with an employer.
310;unless it's visible or actively and noticably influencing my behaviour, I think it's none of their business
311;depends on the role and the company as to their response to that
312;
313;If the health issue could reasonably impact my ability to perform my duties, providing that information would be relevant. However, if I was confident the impact would be minimal, there would be no reason to offer unnecessary information. 
314;
315;I have physical health issues which I am not able to hide and which I require accommodation for in many situations or cannot function.  I discuss it when that is absolutely necessary.
316;I would discuss it to make sure I was open and up front about myself and who I am/how I work
317;Could be seen as a weakness, or a reason why you couldn't be as productive.
318;Seems like it could only hurt you
319;It's illegal for them to ask in the U.S. and unless it's relevant to job performance there's no reason for me to bring it up.
320;I have fibromyalgia which still isn't accepted fully in the medical community, so I don't believe it would be handled well by employers (or anybody, really).
321;If it was going to effect my position, I would bring it up.
322;
323;It would depend on the relevance said issue had to the job - for example, I wouldn't feel the need to bring up a knee problem for a desk job interview. If I had a chronic physical health issue that would require me to take breaks or time off, I would be upfront about it. 
324;
325;It would depend on the nature of the job and the physical health issue - if there would be a direct impact on my ability to work because of the issue.  If not relevant, I would not disclose.
326;I would be afraid that it would result in me being passed up for the position.
327;I would bring up a physical health issue because, compared with mental health issues, i feel that there is no prejudices
328;If I have a physical health issue and it has the potential to interfere with my work life, I must be upfront about it.
329;i would not want to give the interviewer any reason at all to disqualify me
330;I guess it really depends on whether it is necessary for the job. If it will not impact day-to-day work, it would not be necessary
331;There is no stigma against physical health issue like there is with mental health.
332;Being viewed as problematic. Too personal. Maybe allude to it vaguely, at best.
333;
334;May not be relevant. 
335;I would as likely it would effect my work
336;I think physical health issues are easy to empathize with and understand, so I don't think mentioning it would affect me negatively
337;If it doesn't affect my job, I don't feel that a potential employer has a need to know.
338;Depends on the employer and how specifically it is referenced.  Likely would ask about their short-term disability and qualifying events
339;It depends on the relevance for the job and my functioning there-in
341;It could mean time off/etc so the employer needs to be informed.
342;
343;Seems irrelevant and embarrassing
344;I would not want to work for an employer that reacted negatively to a physical health issue. I think it's a good test to ensure that they're the kind of employer I'd want to work for. 
345;I would worry that a potential employer might see a physical illness as a reason I might not be able to work, or to be available for work as much as this profession demands.
346;i would do it if it makes me unable to perform certain tasks (cannot be exposed to certain liquids, heavy things lifting, etc)
347;Unsure
348;I don't think I'd bring up any type of health issues in an interview unless they are not offering health care, which in that case - I did bring up a few issues of physical health in one interview.
349;
350;Many organizations look for any reason to reject a candidate during the interview process.
351;"It would depend on the specific issue.
If it impacts my work I would mention it. Otherwise I would not."
352;Fear of being disqualified for the job
353;If the issue affected my work, I would want the employer to know about it at the time of hiring, to avoid conflict later.
354;If it does not affect my work, it is none of their business.
355;I feel like bringing up a physical health issue would be a mark against me getting the job. If they had the choice between myself and another candidate that didn't mention a health issue, I feel they would take the other candidate.
356;I would bring it up if it were relevant to my performance.
357;I have some vision issues that require me to use basic assistive technology (zooming screen, mainly) and depending on what we would be doing in an interview, my needing to see something bigger or closer may come up.
358;Depends on the nature of the physical health issue, whether it was chronic and the impact on the work. In almost all cases, I would not discuss it because just increases the chance of discrimination.
359;Judgement
360;Will only bring it up if it was relevant
361;"I have this idea that ""signs of weakness"" will always be a disadvantage in an interview"
362;Unless applying for something that required specific physical skills, I don't believe physical health should be a factor in an interview.
363;I barely know these people, probably, and I'd rather not give them any reasons to turn me down. I don't see an upside.
364;
365;
366;circumstantial
367;Better to have it out with them now rather than wait. Have spoken in the industry about burnout.
368;It is generally not relevant to employment.
369;
370;I don't even talk about health issues to acquaintances -- only to close family and friends
371;Honesty
372;It would be something they would need to know, so better to know if it's the type of place that does or doesn't understand that.
373;Depends what it is. If it's something relevant that affects my physical functioning (e.g. if I was blinded or had no legs or something)
374;Fear. 
375;I don't have any chronic physical illnesses, but my partner does.  If I had the same illness as them, I would feel that the interviewer would likely discount my ability to work effectively or feel that the necessary accommodations would be too significant.
376;Health issues do not affect my productivity as a worker while I am in the «working» state (i.e. not absent due to some illness), so why should I discuss them in an interview?
377;Still too much stigma attached to some physical health issues, e.g. female anatomy-related
378;If it was something major I would, but minor no.
379;If they had a medical screening process that would be the appropriate time 
380;It is what it is. If that causes a problem, I should not work there.
381;Depends on the issue and whether it would impact my ability to do the job in question or not. 
382;If it didn't affect my job, I would wait until after I was hired to discuss it with my manager
383;I don't think its an issue that needs to be discussed in an interview.
384;Maybe a second or third interview, but not the first. It's not their business, unless we're both serious about working together.
385;Some parts of tech require you to lift things, for example.
386;
387;It may affect job attendance.
388;Only after I received a job offer, to ensure protection for my physical disability. 
389;Most people understand physical health issues whereas with mental health you can never be sure 
390;discrimination 
391;I feel like physical health issues is perceived to be less in control by the person compared to mental health.
392;
393;None of their business.
394;I've never had one that would be relevant.
395;depends if it would jeopardize my chances of getting the position
396;negative connotation 
397;I assume the candidate is at least in his second stage of the interview. Being open about our limitations is a important topic during this stage of the interview. And since you've made it trought the first, there should be no wrong answers that could cause a negative result in your interview.
398;If it impacted the job I would most likely bring it up towards the end of the interview - more as a I would need some flexibility around this. But I'd want to be a contender for the job before I did. 
399;It is none of their business. As long as I can do the job given parameters we both agree upon, I see no need for them to know. 
400;
401;i would not bring it to up until I received an offer, unless it impacted my interview performance.
402;
403;Physical is more accepted.
404;Fear of being discriminated
405;I don't know
406;If it's relevant or would affect my duties.
407;can't imagine this making my desired outcome more likely
408;Not sure I'd be discriminated against by just not getting an offer. It'd be very hard to prove.
409;Because as long as I can do my job, it's really not any of their business.
410;I'm hesitant to bring up anything that might make me seem less employable but has no actual effect on my productivity.
411;Don't currently have one, so not sure I'd have anything to bring up. Haven't had to think about it.
412;
413;It's none of her business if it doesn't impact my ability to work
414;Because I value honesty very much and know that setting expectations in very beneficial for everybody
415;Depends on the view of the employer about mental health.
416;If it affected my work or was something obvious I would talk about it.
417;It depends how well I connected with the interviewer
418;
419;It may affect my availability to perform my job
420;
421;Not relevant
422;I wouldn't want to work for an employer who couldn't handle the fact that I (or any coworkers) might have a health issue.
423;No reason to risk the job
424;You can be assured that it would not be a taken as a negative. 
425;Unknown ramifications. 
426;
427;
428;if relevant to job
429;I want to be considered the same as every other applicant, and not be categorized by my limitations.
430;If the potential employer explained their position on support for employees with physical health issues at the start of an interview, that would encourage me to speak of it.
431;
432;I wouldn't know if I could trust them at that stage
433;unless it would directly inhibit my ability to perform the presumed role or job description i find my physical medical health to be my responsibility and business altogether next to my diet, sexual preferences and similar information. 
434;Would not wish to prejudice the interview process
435;
436;First I would like them to focus on my abilities and skills. Then when I would pass the initial interview rounds I would bring it up.
437;Would very much depend on the issue and what impact I thought it would have on the role I was interviewing for.
438;Is it relevant to the job, is it something I can work around.
439;
440;personal info should not be part of interview process
441;BECAUSE
442;
443;If I thought it irrelevant to the job.
444;It would probably impact my application negatively (even if they did not admit so)
445;
446;Fear of discrimination as a racial minority with a physical health issue
447;
448;Worries about discrimination
449;
451;"It would depend on the job I'm applying for.  Would it be something like ""I just need a special chair"" or would it be more along the lines of ""I need you to cater to my random days off.""  Either one _should_ be the same, however we all know that each response would not be treated as such."
452;Get the job first.
453;If it affected my availability.
454;I kind of feel uncomfortable saying I can't do things, although I guess I would have to in certain situations
455;
456;Why risk implicit or overt bias?
457;There is established non-discrimination policy for disabilities or physical ability
458;I don't know that it's good, but I typically take management of physical health issues as a personal matter, and wouldn't involve a potential employer.
459;It depends on whether or not he physical health issue would prevent me from doing my job. If not, I would not bring it up.
460;if it affected the ability for someone to preform their job.
461;See it as potentially influencing my hirability. 
462;I don't currently have any I'm concerned about.
463;
464;It depends on the physical health issue. E.g. Bad Knees vs Bad Allergies
465;
466;Depends on the feel of the interview
467;
468;Regardless of what disability legislation says, health issues are a surefire way to get turned down for work.
469;
470;I believe I would  just for the sake of transparency
471;
472;It depends on if it was relevant or affected my job in any way. Also, if I felt like I could trust the person in my interview.
473;
474;If it affected my ability to perform at the job I would bring it up.
475;Seems irrelevant.
476;
477;I don't see the need. If I'm at the interview, it's because I am fine working there as I am.
478;
479;A sleep-related disorder prevents me from being able to arrive at early hours, which a large part of employers require.
480;
481;
482;a
483;It seems like it would be hard to hide a physical issue.
484;It would depend on whether I thought it might impact the job.
485;Fear of being passed over for a healthier candidate.
486;I'm ashamed / shy to admit something like this to a stranger. Unless I have a bond of a certain amount of intimacy with a person, I would never talk about myself in personal terms.
487;because it is important to do the job
488;The employers reaction would tell a lot of the type of company I'd be joining. 
489;If it was relevant to the job, then yes.
490;I would bring it up only if it were already obvious and/or would not be likely to affect my performance.
491;I would rather not bring something up unless I was sure it would impact my job, because I am always concerned that people will find it easier to turn me down as a candidate.
492;Not sure. Want to put my best foot forward.
493;It has no legal bearing on the hiring process
494;Not sure if they're allowed to ask. If it came up I practice openness and honestly by principle.
495;
496;If the physical health issue required some special equipment, like a standing desk or the like, I would bring it up. Otherwise, I wouldn't deem it necessary for them to know.
497;I'd be worried that it would reflect negatively against me and possibly hinder me as a potential candidate
498;It's a market, it would devalue the offering stupid
499;Would sour interview experience
500;If it isn't directly job affecting, I don't think it should matter.
501;Only if it was an obvious thing. If an employer cant tell i wont risk it
502;If I had mobility problems that required an accessible office or special accomodations, I'd want to make sure those were available
503;
504;
505;May not obtain job. NOTE: Was terminated for mental health snap - schizoaffective disorder type one, depressive. All I did was cry for 5 minutes...then lapsed in to confusion. Terminated next week.
506;
507;If I had physical health issues, I would want to make sure there are provisions for my health needs or concerns before accepting a position with a new company.
508;bias
509;"I believe that would bias the interview against me for ""culture"" reasons. "
510;It might depend on how I think they would perceive that issue in relation to my ability to do the job.
512;
513;I feel that is too early in the process. Guess it would depend on how serious I was about working for and how serious a company was about hiring me. 
514;
515;
516;"I believe in playing open cards; If someone has a problem with it, then better get aware of it early on; In IT there are plenty of alternatives"
517;Because you cannot lie about it, since it's gonna show up at some point since physical disorder often comes with not being able to do certain things the same way as people who don't suffer disorders.
518;If I believe it would be relevant to the job I'm interviewing for (if I would need some kind of accommodation for my issue).  Otherwise, I think it would reduce my chances of being hired.
519;It would depend on the situation. For example, if there were office cats, it would be a problem as I'm allergic to cats. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't say anything unless there was a specific discussion about desks & ergonomics. I wouldn't want them to worry that they were going to have to spend a fortune on special desks or chairs, etc.
520;Because they wouldn't hire me probably
521;Physical health issues in our line of work rarely effect our ability to perform.
522;Problems are problems. No one wants to hear about problems. They want solutions. Possible physical issues could lead to other issues that could impact performance.
523;"Because the “survival of the fittest"" mentality. No one wants to ihre someone with the probably highscore of sick days"
524;It depends if it really matters. I suffer from heartburn which is crippling if I eat particular foods or drinks (mainly caffeine, poor me eh). But it's just my life and I'm used to it and it has no bearing on my work. If it did have an impact on my work in some way, or that employer could be more accommodating to help reduce the impact it would have then I'd of course discuss it. Not during interviewing though... who does that!
525;If it's going to affect my role, I should bring it up.
526;Feel it would go against mr
527;I am fortunate enough to not have a condition that requires accommodation. 
528;
529;I dont have a problem discussing my personal limitations with anyone.
530;
531;Embarrasment
532;If it was a personal matter, I'd try not to let it effect my work
533;
534;Depends on whether I thought it would impact job performance, and whether I would expect allowances to be made for my health issue.
535;It's more likely that I wouldn't think it would be relevant.
536;My potential employment should not be contingent on anything the ADA covers.
537;It's not pertinent to the position.
538;"Not their business unless it would impact how I do my job in a way that they're allowed to care about
"
539;
540;I want to make sure both parties can make an informed decision - leaving something important unsaid would foster frustrated expectations.
541;Negative Feedback, Termination, Ridicule,
542;I would only bring it up if the issue would affect my job. Or only if it might affect my job within 3-6 months.
543;To be up front about any factors that may affect my work performance. 
544;If it was likely to affect my chances of being employed, no. My issue only occasionally impacts my ability to work
545;It is important for everyone to be informed of the situation.
547;
548;
549;I would never bring up health issues, because it may be perceived as a negative for reliability of employee.
550;
551;If it was important to my health or well being I could like them to know
552;I assume that it would weigh against me getting the job
553;
554;Maybe if it related to my work
555;Biases exist 
556;If it impacted or could impact my ability to do my job, they should have the right to know about it.
557;I feel this would negatively reflect on your potential.
558;No, I don't want them to feel like I would be a burden.
559;I would not bring up a physical health issue in an interview because I believe it would hinder my possibility of getting the job.
560;It should never be a criteria for hiring me.
561;"Physical health issues that impact my job are necessary for them to know for them to make an informed decision. This would probably change to ""no"" if I NEEDED the job as opposed to just wanted the job."
562;Only if it would directly affect my work, otherwise it's not their business.
564;It may affect time I need to take off or my ability to do certain tasks.
565;xxx
566;They may not employ me
567;If I wouldn't mention it, it could cause trouble afterward.
568;
569;I would if it required adaptations on the part of the employer for me to be able to take the job.
570;I'm afraid it would impact my ability to get a job.
571;
572;It depends on what the issue was. If the issue required a significant amount of time off I would worry about how it would impact my chances of getting the job.
573;Diabetes is a prominent part of my life - it impacts my ability to work in multiple ways, as well as when I get in and when I may have to leave. If my blood sugar is low in the mornings, I have no say in the matter - I need to treat it before I can drive into an office.
574;i've had previous employers that responded negatively to that
575;
576;"depends if the physical issue was considered a ""common"" issue; for example an amputation.  But perhaps not if it was a ""heart disorder"" ... or something not visible to others."
577;It really depends.
578;I'm a private person in general, I may not bring it up.
579;It would depend on the nature and severity/impairment
580;Because I would want the job.
581;Potential negative consequences down the road.
582;If I was not really interested in the job.  I would wait until I knew that I was really interested before getting that personal.
583;
584;I would be uncomfortable working for anyone with whom I couldn't discuss physical health. 
585;
586;It depends on how relevant it would be to my work performance.
587;
588;If it would require accommodations at work.
589;maybe they will go for recruiting a healthy person 
590;I am stressed clinically diagnosed. So i should discuss that.
591;I have MS and there are some stigmas with MS. Some people with MS have cognitive issues.
592;
593;Because there's nothing to be ashamed of.
594;Afraid it would affect outcome
595;Depends on the physical issue and how impacting it is to my ability to work.
596;
597;it may prevent me from getting the job
598;
599;
600;If it doesn't affect my performance while doing the job, then it kind of depends on the situation
601;
602;If and when it affects me in the workplace my employer can adjust my workplace.
603;Important to bring them up so that all parties are aware.  Hiding a Physical Health issue would never end well for either party.  All conversation should be open and all cards on the table.
604;no need to do so
605;"It would depend on the position (on-site vs remote) and even then on the ""vibe"" with the interviewer, if I felt a low risk of bringing up the topic."
606;It would only hurt your chances of being hired. And if you don't get hired you'll wonder for the rest of your life if that affected it
607;Physical health issues are not typically seen as roadblocks to productivity and communication.
608;
609;Any perceived issue could affect hirability, anti-discrimination policy or no. 
610;The word 'cancer' terrifies everyone.
611;
612;
613;
614;
615;I would discuss issue because health is what make your work process effective 
616;If it impacted my ability to do my job or even if I was going to need to take time to visit a doctor or time to recover then I would need to coordinate with them.
617;I don't want to screw my chances at the job.
618;
619;Because I think it would hurt your chances of being hired. Although it depends on the physical issue.
620;We're interviewing for skills, not personal issues.
621;
622;"If the physical health issue has no impact on my ability to do my job, from my perspective, I see no reason to discuss it. For instance, if I have a hemorrhoid, I can still do my job and my company does not need to know.

If I have no arms because of a mechanical accident, then I may have some difficulty with a job that requires the use of hands, and I would probably tell my employer during my interview that I have no hands."
623;Worried about negative perceptions 
624;Physical health is socially considered more legitimate
625;
626;
627;I would assume I was legally protected from issues arising from discussing it.
628;if it did not affect my job performance i would not discuss it
629;It would probably depend on the specific physical health issue, but I would worry about it affecting my chances to land that job, especially if I would need special treatment / time off of work / etc.
630;
631;Physical health problems do not carry the same stigma. Mental health problems are considered a weakness.
632;
633;It would depend on whether it was relevant to the job, if it would effect it negatively. 
634;It's relevant 
635;less stigma
636;I have an issue and always bring it up
637;Afraid of prejudice 
638;
639;It might impact me negatively.
640;honesty
641;It's often easier to talk about. Less stigma associated with it.
642;
643;It's none of their business unless I need an accommodation, which for the work I do, I generally don't 
644;
645;
646;
647;
648;
649;Only if an accommodation were needed as condition of employment, or I needed the answer in deciding whether to accept employment
650;because it would kill my job chances
651;Might have. Bad impact on how they view my performance 
652;I wouldn't want any mental health issues to affect hiring decisions with respect to me.
653;
654;Employers seem to be more willing to deal with workplace assistance for physical ailments.
655;I would only bring it up if relevent.
656;Legislation in my jurisdiction mandates certain protections for employees who need concessions due to health.
657;As a matter of privacy, I would not.
658;I don't want to add any cause for bias until the hiring has been decided one way or another.
659;
660;
661;Depends on the issue, how it affected my work or responsibilities.
662;My mental health issues are well-managed. I'm open about them with people I trust, and happy to discuss them overall. But, it hasn't been relevant to bring up in the workplace. 
663;It may unconsciously affect their decision.
664;Getting the job would be more important in the short term.
665;I would want a potential employer to understand the extent of my physical abilities and limitations up front to prevent misunderstandings down the road.
666;Not relevant to hiring process
667;Wouldn't want to jeopardize my chances at the position
668;Depends on if it would affect my job, and even then I wouldn't necessarily bring it up in case it made them not hire me. Like a pregnancy for example.
669;don't want it to effect willingness to give me job
670;It depends on the severity of the issue
671;I would wait until I have an offer.
672;To make sure that my physical health issues would be accomodated
673;if it affected my ability to do the work, if it required modifications to my environment
674;
675;"I would like to think that health issues should be unrelated to the hiring process, but I know this is not always the case. Thus my ""maybe"" answer."
676;This has always resulted in being turned down for the position I interviewed for.
677;
678;Only if it's something I would need accommodations for
679;I would not want it to prevent me from getting the job.
680;It's not relevant.
681;There's always the concern that someone else would get hired purely out of the convenience for the employer of not having to deal with a physical health issue
682;
683;I think it could lead to not being hired.
684;
685;Just one more thing to filter me out 
686;The interviewer might be uninformed as to the impact of my disability on my ability to do the job.
687;It would depend on the job requirements and expectations
688;im not gonna risk that
689;People like to associate mental health with drama, and might feel like you'd make the workplace more hostile.
690;depends if it is relevant to my job
691;
692;It would have bearing on the job
693;
694;Pretty obvious when you're on crutches, tends to raise questions!
695;
696;currently no reason to. 
697;In usual enterprises do not give importance to health or problems from the 'worker'. It is a big wall, still, unhapiness. 
698;If it would limit or prevent me from doing my job or interfere with work schedules.
699;
700;Doesn't seem appropriate at an interview.
701;A health issue would have a negative effect on getting the job.
702;Health benefits are expensive and few business hire someone they know will cost them a lot.
703;
704;maybe this physical health issue will not change the way I work
705;
706;
707;
708;I would bring it up if I am asked or if during the interview I think such issue may influence my performance.
709;
710;Immediate disqualification
711;I have a physical disability that is not visible. If I don't bring it up, it will make itself known down the line. Better to bring it up when I am in control of the situation, than to call in sick and surprise the employer. This also affect insurance policy, so keeping it hidden doesn't work out so well.
712;Because physical issues are visible
713;Because if they can't deal with it, then I don't want to work with them.
714;
715;If it will affect my work, or require that I be treated differently from others, the employer needs to know about it before hiring me.
716;Fear of not getting the job
717;There isn't a physical health issue that would affect the sort of work I do without stopping me working altogether.
718;It has nothing to do with my ability to perform my role.
719;I have back issues, neck issues and on occasion may need time off for treatment
720;I think it would lower my chances of getting the job and take away from all the things that I can bring to the job! 
721;Well of course the employer doesn't want to hire people with significant physical health issues, especially if it's the first issue which comes up. Iv'e had to fill in Afghanistan for my country as asking country would make it too easy to identify me. You shouldn't be asking such personal questions on an anonymous survey.
722;Unless the issue severely stops me from working, I think mentioning it would affect my chances. 
723;
724;It depends on the issue and how I feel like the employer is likely to respond.
725;If i felt it would negatively effect my chances of getting the position
726;Not unless it was relevant to my job, but I do not go after jobs where that could be and I do not really have any physical health issues. I would not bring up an intention to get pregnant either (which could be considered as such).
727;I would not feel it inappropriate
728;
729;I am privileged enough to know how to do prior research. I expect to find answers to my question in existing resources on the HR site.
730;If I was desperate for the job, I would not want to jeopardize my candidacy. On the other hand, if the health issue was very serious and could interfere with the responsibilities of the position, I feel that the employer should probably know about it.
731;
732;depends on the issue, afraid of presumptions
733;Would be concerned I wouldn't be considered for the position.
734;For example I might need a standing desk or special chair, that is considered more 'normal' than explaining your special needs for a mental health condition. 
735;If it would impact my performance.
736;It would really depend on the circumstances
737;During the interview process I wouldn't yet know details of the company's policy on this.
738;
740;It's relevant.
741;Would just depend on the relevance to the discussion.  I wouldn't bring it up unless necessary.
742;Yes if it would impact my work
743;Depends on the physical health issue and how severely it affects me. For example, I would talk about my carpal tunnel, because it affects my job performance and I need ergonomic keyboards and mice in order to not be in constant pain. I wouldn't bring up my polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) because it does not affect my work performance.
744;
745;If I have a physical health issue, the new employer needs to be aware of it before hiring me.
746;
747;Depends on the employer, the mood and the flow of the conversation. Nothing is set in stone, conversations like these are fluid.
748;I expect to be discriminated against.
749;physical health is something that has no stigma attached. Although many places won't hire you, or look for ways to get rid of you if they can't get 100% productivity out of you.
750;I am concerned that it would count against me at interview stage.
751;If i felt it needed special accommodation that could restrict my ability to perform the job if assistance not provided.
752;As a middle-aged women coder, I feel I already have two strikes against me when I interview.
753;Unless the health issue relates specifically to my ability to do the job I would not feel a need to bring it up. 
754;I work in tech so physical issues, unless my hard is broken, doesn't matter.
755;Anything that would add complications or additional load on my potential employer seems to only have negative ramifications.
756;
757;It would depend on whether the issue would affect my needs in the workplace. If so, bring it up. If not, it's not necessary to bring up.
758;If I felt it was important, I wouldn't feel it was likely that there would be any negative effect from sharing this.
759;
760;
761;I guess it would depend on what type of physical issue it was and how often it may affect my work as far as absences for treatment, etc.
762;I don't feel that a physical disability should be a deciding factor in someone's potential employment.  
763;Don't want to be discriminated against
764;
765;If they made an offer and the issue would impact my work or scheduling. 
766;Depends on the context.
767;.
768;it would depend on how and/or if the issue would impact my ability to fulfill the role. i would also want to feel the employer out as best as possible before providing personal non-required information.
769;It shouldn't matter
770;There are many laws that protect applicants from discrimination based on physical ability so I wouldn't feel too concerned about bringing up a physical health issue in an interview.
771;Although it should be protected, not convinced it wouldn't harm my chances.
772;It could reduce my hire-ability, even though it may not as well, why take a chance?
773;Depends on the context, usually they have no need to know
774;they would hold it against you
775;
776;Because why do they need to know.
777;Not their place
778;Because it's an unfortunate part of who I am.
779;Should not be relevant to hiring deicition
780;It would depend on the physical health issue. To me, no one should be treated differently based on a health issue. But some employers might be turned off by that information.
781;Not sure if it would affect my work
782;
783;Potential discrimination
784;If the physical health issue would affect my job yes I would bring it up. Mental health issue I would not, I see the problem here, but I still wouldn't bring it up :/
785;depends what the issue is.
786;It would depend on the type of issue. A broken leg wouldn't be relevant.
787;Fear of no offer
788;
789;I'm not sure discussing weaknesses is what interviews are for!
790;Fear it would negatively bias myself
791;It could negatively influence my chances of being hired.
792;
793;
794;Not relevant
795;Fear of discrimination
796;Only if it affected my ability to do the job
798;Everybody's had a physical health issue at some point in their life.
799;I have chronic lower back pain due to a narrow disk.  I would have no problem telling my employer about this if I felt lifting would be a part of my job.
800;It would depend on the issue and the job.
801;Prefer to focus on benefits I bring. 
802;To test how supportive the environment will be.
803;Fear of not getting the job.
804;Depends on relevance to work 
805;
806;It would negatively affect my chances of gaining employment
807;I would not want a possibly unrelated physical impairment to interfere with the prospect of being hired
809; Don't trust potential employers to not judge.
810;If it was something to do with a workspace like requiring a standing desk etc 
812;
813;Private 
814;Typically more common and, in my eyes, physical health issues do not have a stigma attached to them like many mental health issues. Any kind of mental health issue tends to leave a lot of people ending up with some sort of 'label'.
815;
816;It's not relevant to my ability to code. I'm also protected by EU law on disability.
817;It would limit potential for employment
818;Depends on the job and organisation
819;Unsure how they would react. Even good people have unconcious bias..
820;"Because I'd be automatically sorted out. Let's face it folks: Whether its a ""physical"" or a ""mental"" impairment, reality and the ""would be nice"" situation / laws are two complete different things."
821;Because it's illegal for them to ask and there is no obligation for me to offer the information.
822;I need an ergonomic keyboard (preferably my own) this is a thing I'd absolutely mention during the interview process. I'd be a bit more reticent to discuss my back pain
824;
825;
826;I don't want it to affect me getting the job.
827;Depending on the nature of the health issue, I may feel uncomfortable sharing it with someone I'm not close to.
828;I would bring it up if it affected my ability to do the job. I wouldn't bring it up if it felt irrelevant and wouldn't affect my ability to do the job.
829;Afraid it would cost me the job.
830;
831;From the interviewing advice I've read, health issues should be brought up at the offer stage, not during the interview. If I had a good rapport with the interviewer, I might bring it up in the interview. Otherwise, I wouldn't mention it until offered the job.
832;If I had a health issue and want coverage, it's important I be up front about it to ensure I'm eligible for such coverage. 
833;Because it's important.
834;
835;Yes, If relevant to the duties of the position. Otherwise, not necessary. 
836;I would not want to preclude myself from employment based on something that was irrelevant to my abilities to complete my job.  If potentially having a lot of doctor's appointments is the only drawback for my employer, they shouldn't weigh another application as stronger based on that.
837;To avoid being potentially disqualified due to that fact.
838;Often it's important to being able to accomplish the job... so yes, it would need to be discussed.
839;
840;It depends how obvious it is (visually) and how it would affect my work
841;If I want the job, I should be at my full health, so. It's cultural thing here too.
842;Could impact the outcome of the interview.
843;If accomodations are needed, it's required by law to do so.
844;Potentially affects my capabilities on the job.
845;Worried it may affect my chances of getting the job.
846;Talking about health issues has always been responded to as though I'm asking for personal accommodation, even when I'm just trying to raise awareness for something that's widespread. Bringing it up in an interview would be putting the cart before the horse.
847;
848;If it wasn't immediately apparent and/or it was embarassing to talk about with someone who is not family or a close friend, I wouldn't tell them.
849;If it is going to be something that Im dealing with at the time or something that is noticeable then yes. I feel that most employers would be more accepting of a physical health issue than a mental health issue. 
850;
851;I have an eye condition that will require medical leave at some yet to be determined future point.
852;Depends on relevance to performance
853;It could be seen as a weakness, or the potential employer could see it as a person trying to take advantage of their healthcare plan.
854;They might not be willing to give me a shot. That's how I feel.
855;if it affected my ablility to do my work
856;The competition is to fierce to reveal any weaknesses or deficits that might effect their decision to hire. But I WOULD reveal if I thought it would affect my performance.
857;what if it was the one difference between me and the competition 
858;
859;It would become obvious later if it didn't come up during the interview.
860;Some physical issues can be private too.
861;"It depends on the physical health issue. There are too many companies in tech that worship the ""dev rock star"" stereotype where long hours and the sacrifice of work balance is held in higher regard. They will work devs to the bone if we allow them too. Any resistance to working too many hours is labeled as ""rebellion"". I've worked jobs where I had to strategically plan my days off because I couldn't afford to lose all my PTOs and as a result, have forced myself to go to work even while having asthma or being sick. Basically, if I'm not half dead, then I can make it to work because I need to ""save those days for when I really need it""."
862;I feel it's best to be candid in an interview, especially in regards to how the employer might be able to accommodate a physical (or mental) health issue.
863;I would assume that would put me lower on the list for getting the job
864;I feel like it would effect my chances of getting a job. It's also none of their business unless it effects my performance.
865;
866;
867;Physical health issues are not stigmatized.
868;My physical health is a personal issue.  I would only discuss this with people after I have established that I can trust them.
869;I've seen people with physical health issues previously accommodated for
870;
871;I don't know
872;Instead of concentrating on capabilities I believe they would have their mind go off on accommodations that would have to be made for me. It might even cloud any other thoughts on points of discussion. 
873;Depends on their character.
874;
875;Depends, if it affects the productivity, no
876;Privacy 
878;I don't feel that it is their business and although they should not take it into consideration when hiring, let's be honest, they do.
880;
881;Id be afraid discussing any health issue at an interview would be used against me.
882;I've actually had to do this for an employer who required a drug test (I was on a prescription from a doctor for a medical condition and would have tested positive for steroids), so I disclosed up front so there weren't any surprises. In general, however, I wouldn't disclose unless it was necessary.
883;
884;employer have incentives (to pay less taxes) to hire ppl w/ disabilities in france
885;I would bring it up only if I would need accommodations in order to do my job.
886;"because, fuck them, if they think it's an issue. It's their problem; not mine."
888;There's little stigma around a physical health issue, and it could even become a personal talking point where it'd make a connection with someone.
889;I believe in total transparency. If it's not appreciated, then I know the potential employer is not for me.
890;Idk
891;Depends on whether it might hinder or modify the way I work at the employer 
892;Seems like it would work against me
893;"It's simple: They need to know who they're hiring.
"
894;
895;honesty
896;I decide this based on my feelings towards my counterpart. If I feel that the interviewer is a kind human beeing I'll bring it up. Otherwise I don't.
897;For short term and temporary contracts, there's no way you would get the job.
898;
899;I would not interview for a position where I believe my physical health may negatively impact my productivity.
900;If it's not a disability accommodation requirement, they don't need to know.
901;bias. a lack of understanding.
902;Ensuring they have support for repetitive strain injury coverage, for example.
903;I feel they might be biased
904;I would bring it up if I required special equipment to do my job, or if I felt the need to explain how I can do my job despite the physical issue.
905;Because I don't trust insurance companies.
906;You don't want to give a potential employer a reason not to hire you.
907;If it directly impacted my ability to work, I would bring it up.
908;
909;Fear it would impact negatively on getting the position.
910;Trying to get a job
911;It's illegal for that to effect a job offer. 
912;
913;I would fear that it would affect my chances of getting the job.
914;I don't want them to think I can't work
915;I'd need to know more about their own personal characteristics first.
916;Only if relevant and would need accommodation.
917;
918;Dependant on how comfortable I felt speaking the interviewer(s), dependant if they have mentioned there is an avenue/approach they embrace to address physical health issues.
919;If I felt it would reduce my chance of getting the job and at the same time it would not impede my ability to *do* the job, I wouldn't mention it.
921;if it were irrelevant to the job, I wouldn't
922;Under UK law it's none of their business at that stage.
923;I'm an honest person.
924;I think it's important in interviews to lay out exactly what you want on the table. If I had a health issue that needed accommodating, I'd want to ensure that was done.
925;Because physical health is an accepted illness. Mental illness is considered to be an opt-out at times. 
926;Depends in the health issue
927;Worried about potential discrimination associated with taking time off work
928;Might effect work, and it seems accepted
929;
930;there's no stigma attached to physical health, it's an ailment.
931;I have a long-term chronic/constant headache and, well, it impedes my work from time to time. They need to be aware/okay with that.
932;It seems like it would generally be useless information but may lend towards casual conversation. Like ice breaking.
933;I think it would depend on the job requirements and the limitations my physical health would have on carrying out my duties.
934;I am not sure it would hinder my place in the job
935;I would likely perceive that as irrelevant to the interview process.
936;
937;
938;Most likely not, if I felt that it would harm my chances of getting a job.
939;I would only bring it up if it affected my ability to do my job
940;Not impacting my performance
941;
942;Wouldn't want to risk job
943;Some physical health has stigma attached, other does not.
944;If it would require minor accommodations that would not be perceived as overly onerous.
945;
947;
948;Bias happens. I wouldn't want it to be a factor. However, I'm overweight, and I know it's been a factor in some interviews. Can't hide that. Even though that is the only thing I have wrong with me.
949;Depends, if it affected the job then yes I would talk about it. 
950;Not comfortable speaking about anything health related at work.
951;
952;If it affected my ability to perform the job or get/to from work. 
953;I would rather have our conversation and my qualifications be the focus of an interview.
954;
955;If it affect my job performance they should know
956;This is a personal matter and I don't feel that I have to mention it if it does not impact my ability to work. 
957;Would lower chances of getting the job
958;Does not seem relevant or helpful to bring up in interview.
959;Other than perhaps asking about benefits that I would need/want it's not really their business unless it impacts my daily work.
960;It isn't something they should use to determine if I'm a good candidate for the job
961;If my potential employer needs to know (that it may affect my work) I feel its best to be honest so they know what they are getting if I joined their company
962;If I thought it would impact my chances at getting a job wouldn't bring it up unless asked.
963;It seems like it would influence decisionmaking, even subconsciously.
964;I feel physical injuries are more acceptable now.
965;Physical stuff happens so there isn't a stigma attached to a physical health issue like there is with a mental health issue.
966;would be afraid not to put the best foot forward
967;fear of losing out
968;My employer would need to be aware of any limitations that could reasonably affect my work performance
969;It is good to be open
970;Discrimination and not hired
971;Shouldn't generally be relevant
972;Fear it would disadvantage the result
973;Nobody's business but my own.
974;Might prejudice hiring decision
975;I don't feel like it is any of their business if it doesn't impact my ability to work.
976;The employer needs to be aware of how to treat me equally and with respect. If they don't know my (theoretical) condition, they can't be expected to uphold any kind of legal requirements, or provide any help or support.
977;
978;Risk not getting position
979;It depends on if the issue would effect my performance for the job they are hiring for.
980;I feel like it would make a negative impression during the interview or make for an awkward dynamic. At offer time, it would be acceptable.
981;
982;Might affect if I get the job or not
983;
984;I'm a diabetic.
985;
986;Would not want to risk the potential negative outcomes
987;Doesn't concern them
988;
989;I've been struggling with depression for a good six years of my life - maybe longer. But it has taught me so much about myself, and given me insight into life thay I believe other people may never have the chance to get. It also teaches you about yourself, and forces you to become a better person, and never give up.
990;I would hope that it would let me know whether I would fit in at this employer based off of their reaction.
991;Because it's important for them to know who they are hiring and for me to establish my needs early.
992;It would depend upon if it would have any direct or indirect bearing on my position. If it was applicable, I would bring it up. If not, I'd not bring it up unless prompted.
993;
994;
995;
996;If the job required lifting
997;While I don't think a physical health issue would define me as a person, it is definitely something I would want to speak about with them as early as possible so I can see how they react.
998;I should be honest because if in anytime I find any issues related to this physical health issue, I need to be clear about it right from the beginning.
999;Its important to make it clear, sometimes you may have limitations which your employer must be aware. No surprises for both sides
1000;Correctness and openness the base for a healthy wirk relationship
1001;
1002;Risk not getting the job.
1003;
1004;I would not be comfortable appearing in any way vulnerable or give the employer a chance to exercise bias against me
1005;I would because it's not taboo or controversial.
1006;
1007;Although illegal, I wouldn't want a physical health issue to weigh on someones mind when they make the decision whether or not to hire me.
1008;Why not? Sometimes even not-work connected topics come up in interviews
1009;If it's not apparent, they don't need to know. 
1010;I would mention it if and only if it had a direct bearing on my ability to navigate the work environment (if I needed more time to walk from place to place, for example).
1011;
1012;
1013;
1014;If it needs accommodation then I feel you should be upfront and honest
1015;I would bring it up if I found it relevant for my ability to do my job. Otherwise I would not.
1016;
1017;it might impact the services they needed to provide
1018;
1019;There are some things that are protected by law in the US, that I couldn't ask about. If they volunteered the information, I would discuss it.
1020;Fear that it would be used as a reason not to hire me
1021;That shouldn't be part of a hiring decision.
1022;My attitude is that it comes with the package and doesn't have to be mentioned. My skills are still my skills. But I can see situations where I could feel very open and mention it nonetheless (if I can tell that the employer feels the same)
1023;If the issue would significantly impact my work, I would bring it up. If not, I wouldn't.
1024;
1025;It would be uncomfortable
1026;Because it is important
1027;It may affect my work, and by disclosing this, I'm protected by disability laws.
1028;
1029;It would depend on the nature of the physical health issue and the job role. Relevance is probably the most important deciding factor.
1030;It would have no bearing on my ability to do the job
1031;Not relevant to the interview process.
1032;Many physical health issues are obvious and not addressing them is therefore obvious. 
1033;It's personal to me and none of their business.
1034;Could be seen as a potential problem in the future 
1035;"I tend to want to avoid being ""personal"" during interviews. If I felt a physical health problem had no relevance to work, I wouldn't want to discuss it. "
1036;Because it might mean I don't get the job. I have in the last if I knew I had time off coming up or it meant I needed special treatment 
1037;"there are ways to ""legally"" discriminate. it doesn't take much effort to ""legally"" block a new hire for illegal reasons."
1038;depending on the issue it might lower chances of employment
1039;
1040;
1041;Better to disclose something like that up front in case it impacts work.
1042;I want to be seen as an asset, not a burden 
1043;Dramatically lower chance of success.
1044;
1045;I have diabetes and it's a natural thing to mention.
1046;I'd need to ensure that I could manage my back pain on a long term basis with a new employer without any issue in doing so.
1047;
1048;They might disregard me due to already having cause to take sick days off work
1049;If it would have an impact on the job I could do. 
1050;for his selfcare in the environment 
1051;It should not affect the outcome. 
1052;I don't think it's relevant.
1053;it depends how much I feel I trust them
1054;There is no benefit and it's a risk.
1055;I would rather try to get the job first and then raise it if required later
1056;Worried about it interfering with day to day tasks or limiting opprotunities
1057;
1058;Embarrassed
1059;They could hire someone without that issue
1060;
1061;physical health issues are easier for other people to see, depression is easy for others to dismiss
1062;I feel they would be likely to weigh it against me in considering me for the job, whether intentionally/consciously or not.
1063;
1064;It's never come up.
1065;
1066;Worried they wouldn't hire me due to potential cost and work time lost.
1067;I wouldn't expect them to hire me if I did.
1068;
1069;Knowledge about this will make it easier to know if the job is right for me and if I'll be able to handle it.
1070;Not an issue.
1071;Unless it's a physical handicap, I don't want the problem to affect their judgement.
1072;Potentially viewed as disqualifying, even if it's not
1073;Fear of not getting the job 
1074;
1075;If it didn't affect my work performance it would be none of their concern
1076;Well a physical issue is harder to hide than a mental condition
1077;I would feel dishonest if I didn't share known physical issue
1078;bringing it up would be a bad option, places me in a position where I'm less likely to get the job.
1079;"Interviews are a process of elimination. I don't want to give the employer a reason to eliminate me.
If the physical issue were something with clear protections under the law (eg vision impairment, mobility issues), then I would disclose."
1080;It may not be relevant to the job.
1081;
1082;It might make me look like a liability 
1083;If it does not interfere with work, it is none of their business.
1084;I never had a physical health issue.
1085;"It depends on what kind of physical health issue it was, and what the job was. As an example, I do not feel as if Carpal Tunnel would be necessary to bring up if I was not going to be doing repetitive tasks all day. I would probably mention it upon offer, and allow an opportunity for reconsideration.

I would also not mention it if I wasn't interested in the position."
1086;The job market is too competitive.
1087;depends on whether the health issue would actually affect my job or impede performance
1088;I wouldn't want to work someplace where it would be an issue.
1089;If the job required physical work, I would worry that bringing up a physical health issue might have negative consequences.
1090;I wouldn't want it to affect my chances of getting the job.
1091;I have multiple chronic illnesses and have been advised by lawyers to never bring them up in interview situations as discrimination is difficult to prove. 
1092;Fear of discrimination
1093;If it was obvious and was going to effect my workplace
1094;Unless it would affect my ability to perform my duties my health is of no relevance to my employer.
1095;I'd want to be open and transparent.
1096;None of their business 
1097;Physical issues are not treated as taboo — creative employers hire your mind, not your physical ability. 
1098;only if it impacts work
1099;
1100;doesnt carry the same stigma
1101;I don't know
1102;I would bring up physical issues that impact work ability, eg carpal tunnel
1103;"it's already a contentious situation to simply ask for one day off.  i'm not comfortable asking for a sick day (i'll work from home instead).  and i would think i'd be ""throwing"" the interview to ask for a concession at that point in the working relationship, as if it would ensure i would not be called back."
1104;
1105;I would be worried I would not get the job. I might also feel embarassed.
1106;If it prevents me from performing in certain aspects of the job, I think the interviewer needs to know.
1107;Because its apparent and more accepted than a mental issue 
1108;"It depends if it's obvious and how it would affect my work. If I'm doing an ""office job"", my ability to walk wouldn't be that critical."
1109;
1110;I just think it's still frowned upon. Chances of getting a job after mentioning such a thing in an interview would be slim in my opinion.
1111;It's only fair to fully disclose and an employer cannot discriminate against physical health.
1112;
1113;It should be known if they are going to hire you
1114;I feel relatively protected, I think that nothing really bad could happen as far as consequences for that.
1115;It would probably be better in the long run.
1116;
1117;Prejudice
1118;"Don't want to get rejected. But want to be fully open, to build trust and don't start a job with any ""secrets"""
1119;AFAIK, during an interview, it's recommended to not discuss things that may impair one's availability, or might cause excessive drain on insurance benefits. So much so that it might cause the employer to choose another candidate.
1120;
1121;Why? It should make no difference.
1122;Because I feel it would be a big negative.
1123;I wouldn't be interested in bringing up a physical health issue unless it was pertinent and affected my ability to work, healthcare coverage, or schedule. 
1124;I would if I thought it would effect my job performance or if I thought the hiring party might have concerns.
1125;Afraid of seeming weak.
1126;Concerned would not get the job
1127;Fear of implicit bias against me.
1128;I would be worried about not getting hired.
1129;I think it would cause discrimination and get me passed for a job
1130;To check that support/equipment could be provided.
1131;Most people seem to understand physical health issues are outside of our control. 
1132;Depends whether it would be relevant to my performance or cause significant outages. 
1133;Fear and stigma associated with it.
1134;
1135;Well I do IT so a physical health issue would have very little bearing on it 
1136;The physical health issue I would most have reason to discuss is asthma, and it seems like asking for accommodations later if necessary (eg asking for perfumes/scents to be banned) would likely be okay.  Additionally giving information that employers aren't allowed to use for employment decisions like health status before an offer might be made is looking for trouble.  People use information they have, consciously or not.
1137;None of their business, especially if it has no impact on my ability to do the work.
1138;
1139;
1140;It depends on what the job requirements are. For instance, long hours or heavy lifting.
1141;if it does not influence my work, why should i bring it up
1142;Not sure 
1143;
1144;Not everyone is open-minded and regardless of the law, people attach a stigma to conditions that affect the mind as I think they are concerned about things they cannot see.
1145;
1146;Comfort discussing personal issues with someone who I've presumably only recently met.
1147;Shouldn't come up.  If it does, then it might bias potential employer against me.
1148;
1149;if wasn't current, feel that it isn't relevant
1150;It would depend on how I perceived my chances of getting an offer/second interview during that interview. If I really wanted the position, and thought that a physical health issue might deter the employer, I may choose to not bring it up. If I am asked, outright, though, I would not lie.
1151;Fear of negative repercussions
1152;As a type 1 diabetic I try to advocate for equal treatment and would not avoid bringing up a physical health issue
1153;Employer should know about physical health issues that could impact quality of work somehow.
1154;
1155;Seems out of place...certainly wouldn't want interviewer to ask me.
1156;If it impacted my ability to be physically at work or if there were accessibility issues at the office.
1157;Less likely to get the job
1158;Would likely negatively affect selection status.
1159;It would be important that both I and my employer understand the requirements demanded by physical health issues.
1160;The field is already too competitive to disadvantage myself. Plus, it's none of their business as long as it doesn't seriously affect my work.
1161;I am privileged to be choosy with employment and would not want to work where bringing up such issues is problematic.
1162;
1163;Retaliation
1164;I have a (small) physical disability which sometimes affects my work. I guess it's an effective litmus test of the prospective employer's culture.
1165;They might think it will negatively affect my job performance and be less likely to hire me or hire me with a good salary.
1166;
1167;
1168;I believe it would negatively influence their decision on whether to hire me or not
1169;Depends on what the issue was and whether it would affect the kind of work I could do.
1170;
1171;Would depend on physical health issue and how it might affect things.
1173;
1174;
1175;The physical health issue itself, no, because alone it isn't relevant.  The work I had to do to overcome the issue, yes.
1176;I have type 1 diabetes and it will affect my everyday life forever
1177;Fear of negative consequences
1178;
1179;
1180;Depending  on work impact 
1181;If I feel comfortable enough with the interviewer. 
1182;I would not want anything to impact my qualifications or the perception of them
1183;Non of his/her business
1184;
1185;Depends on what it is and how embarrassing it is
1186;
1187;It depends on the issues and the type of job.
1188;Don't see it as a problem for me
1189;I feel like it would not be immediately associated with my productivity or ability to perform.
1190;Scared it would separate me from other interviewees
1191;Physical health for the most part doesn't get in the way of my job directly.
1192;Perceived poorly
1193;There's less stigma. People hear about a physical condition and don't think it's your fault, but when they hear about a mental health condition they think you're dangerous, less trustworthy, and fundamentally wrong somehow.
1194;Depends on how personal and to what extent it would affect my position
1195;I would be worried it would be seen as a pity play or distraction from my qualifications.
1196;If it impacted my work or would require special accommodations, I would mention it.
1197;
1198;Depends on the issue. Maybe you would need accommodations for a wheelchair.
1199;I wouldn't want it to be the reason I was not hired.
1200;
1201;Depends what it was and how it affected my ability to do the job, no change in ability, no discussion.
1202;might affect chances of getting the job
1203;
1204;Bit knowing the environment if the new employer would make me nervous to do so
1205;I want to set expectations up front
1206;Possibly wouldn't receive the job because of too much baggage or they make think I am a complainer 
1207;Because it might affect my ability to get to the office in the future.
1208;
1209;In case it affected how well they though I could do the job/reliability
1210;Not relavent to my job
1211;I'm hesitant to give a potential employer any information that would disqualify me from the position -- legally protected or otherwise. They can always employ parallel construction based on other negative factors to reinforce a biased decision, so giving them extra ammo is a poor strategy for securing a paycheck.
1212;If the physical health issue is chronic, I would be nervous that it would make them more likely to reject the application.
1213;Less stigma
1214;would only bring it up, after the job offer -- and only asking for ergonomic keyboard/chair and better monitor(s). No need to bring it up if they don't offer the job, right?
1215;Wold only bring it up if it would affect doing my job.
1216;Can damage my opportunity to ge in the job
1217;it depends on whether the issue might be perceived as having more impact on my performance than it actually does, and whether i am confident i can explain the impact and work around it.
1218;"I believe disclosing anything about physical health will stop the interviewing process; I've lost interviews before for looking unwell."
1219;Fear of not getting the job
1220;
1221;If that physical heath issue were not germane to the work, I would not bring it up.
1222;
1223;It's better to be open at interviews about all health issues as it speaks to the employer's attitudes as much as anything. 
1224;They don't need to know unless/until it affects my work 
1225;I would be concerned that there would be negative bias, even if unintentional.
1226;Unless it would directly effect my performance in the position, the condition would not be relevant.
1227;I don't have anything serious enough to chance negatively affecting the outcome.
1228;That would be career suicide
1229;
1230;Not being sure about privacy.
1231;If it was going to impact my ability to perform my job, I would feel obligated to let them know.
1232;
1233;The job I go for require a lot of travel, and a physical health issue might impact their belief in my ability to complete my job.
1234;I feel dishonest if I do not disclose things up-front
1235;Depends on the ability to do the job. If it has no bearing, then I wouldn't discuss it. If I needed accommodations to do the job, I may.
1236;I've never had a physical health issue before, so I don't know if I would.
1237;
1238;It depends on what the issue was, if it was chronic or acute, etc. (if acute, probably wouldn't even mention it. Then again, if chronic, might be concerned that it would bias against them hiring me.)
1239;
1240;I would have to read the room, it would  depend on how much i feel an employer expects of me.
1241;Depends on how acute the issue was
1242;Full disclosure
1243;It's non of their business. 
1244;Unsure of how they woud react.
1245;
1246;I feel that an interview is not enough time for an employer to make a rational judgement about whether or not the candidate can still do the job they're asking. I would not disclose my mental health condition to employers during an interview but perhaps prior to accepting an offering.
1247;Especially if it would affect physical access to the location or equipment, it seems like it would be absolutely necessary.
1248;Depends on whether I thought it would have a negative impact on me getting the job
1249;
1250;i don't know
1251;Depends in the interview, would it be relevant at that point, am I seriously interested in the job or not
1252;It depends on the issue—if it affected my job, I would hope to feel comfortable bringing it up.
1253;If the health issue was severe enough to affect my work, waiting to reveal it until after job start could easily result in resentment. All cards on the table.
1255;Your not get the job
1256;I feel I need to be able to physically do the job demands to be considered.
1257;Being open usually is the best
1258;
1259;
1260;
1261;If it could affect my work I would
1262;Don't want to be viewed differently or like I need special treatment.
1263;
1264;If I really wanted the job I wouldn't necessarily bring it up until I knew that I was actually getting the job. I realize that legally I can't be discriminated against, but the odds would be against me.
1265;If I thought it might impact my performance of the job I'd mention it. And if my physical issue is obvious, but I knew it would NOY affect my ability to do the job, I would mention that.
1266;Because they should know up front and it is illegal for them to not hire someone because of a physical impairment or issue
1267;denial of job oportunity
1268;I don't feel that its relevant to my getting hired
1269;It wouldn't have a bearing on my employability.
1270;I'm not sure it's relevant. I don't want to overshare my personal life at a job interview.
1271;
1272;I don't see it as being relevent
1273;To ensure I received proper accommodations if they were needed
1274;I don't feel it could help my chances in any way and could hurt my chances
1275;I would feel it important that a potential employer know of any limitations I may have in being able to do the job
1276;It's unlikely to be any of the prospective employer's business.
1277;I would be afraid of being excluded from consideration due to my occasional back problems. I would only bring it up if it directly impacted the job
1278;Haven't been in that situation, so I really don't know
1279;
1280;If it required hospital treatment or medication. Only feels right they should be aware. 
1281;I would only bring up the issue if necessary, if it obviously affected my work or I required special assistance.
1282;
1283;Fear of failing interview
1284;If it's obvious, I would have to prove I can do the job.
1285;Because it may have some significant impact on my performance if I am not accomodated accordingly.
1286;
1287;
1288;It depends if it was relevant to my work
1289;If it will directly impact my ability to perform my duties on some days, then it's only fair to be honest about it.
1290;I would be concerned that it would affect my chance of getting the job.
1291;I would avoid it as much as possible to put myself in the best possible light.
1292;Fear that I would not make it through the interview process. Would tell after being hired.
1293;It depends on the impact I expected doing so would have.
1294;To be upfront in case the ADA Act were to apply to my employment there.
1295;
1296;Not needed
1297;in order to keep a normal image of myself
1298;Fear that it would affect my chances of getting hired.
1299;my work does not involve physical labor so it doesn't matter and it's private
1300;If I really need the job, I wouldn't take the risk. If I'm just looking for a better job, I would tell, because it's not a better job if they reject me for it.
1302;
1303;"Who's going to hire a ""head case""?"
1304;It is expected and covered standard HR best practice. Plus legal and social obligations are clear to all.  
1305;Set expectations appropriately.
1306;I would be worried that the employer would consider the problem a liability
1307;
1308;
1309;Shouldn't be an issue as long as it does not impact the tasks that I'm interviewing for.
1310;If it would affect my ability to do the work I believe it would be relevant
1311;I've previously been punished for taking care of my physical health after a bike accident. I do not want to be in that situation again, so I would bring up any issues I had while interviewing.
1312;You cannot enforce respect for any group of individuals. Every place I have worked care about performance and social integration. 
1313;If it were to impact my day-to-day job I would bring it up in the discussion. Otherwise I would wait to see how the environment of the company was about accepting less than perfect.
1314;If I felt the issue would not interfere with my performance I would not bring it up. 
1315;
1316;
1317;Physical health issues are unlikely to impact tech work and should be easy to accommodate
1318;If it would impact my work in any way
1319;If the physical health issue affected my ability to do the job yes I would. If not then I wouldn't. 
1320;Fear of unintentional discrimination/negative bias
1321;
1322;I'd probably mention it after I was hired, once I knew I was safe.
1323;I'm hard of hearing which is important to mutually understand in the interview process. Also is a good test of being accommodating or not. 
1324;
1325;Wouldn't seem relevant that early. I would ask questions to get a feel for how accepting the company is. 
1326;"AT least at the places I have worked - IT in banking..it was a very macho hardass culture across the board. In nonprofit spots - the budgets were so tight everyone complained all the time and had it hard...not as hard as me with untreated ADHD, depression and anxiety...but hard. It should have come up in all previous workplaces but I never feel safe bringing it up. I freelance now so I can deal with structuring my own work hours etc...but, I am really really struggling both due to isolation and just...freelancing is a real grind. If I didn't have Obamacare I would be completely screwed. AS it is I am only semi screwed. ALSO  - what I wish you would ask in this survey is about caretaking. 
I am female in IT..and disabled. I take care of my elderly mother and my developmentally disabled brother. 
What NEVER gets discussed is who does the caretaking in families when someone breaks down or is unable to work...it's women, sisters, daughters, mothers... So PLEASE work caretaking survey questions into your surveys.

I can't just say it's about me...I'm under water because no one is helping with my brother or mother..least of all my father who died penniless after years on wall street making millions. He was ADHD too...and alcoholic and depressed...but, he was a ""master of the universe"" type doing IPOs for tech companies...and a ""liberatarian""... 

So yeah - please get more intersectional in how you survey this landscape. I'm screwed NOT just because of my disabilities...but my gender as well.

Sooo - this survey should have a ""Did we miss anything"" open question at the end. Two things. One - My ADHD is an asset when treated and understood...Also - When I finally got coverage at work 20 years ago...I was put on a med which I had a very bad reaction to - at work. Getting treated (after decades) ended up cratering my worklife for ten years or so. Wrong meds *really* messed me up - along with wrong DX. I couldn't be open about it. And then had a serious breakdown at work...and was fired immediately. No mercy. No understanding - I told them what was going on and I was gone. Because I wasn't well.. I couldn't defend myself. I became homeless for a while. I'm OK now...but it was a *mess* caused BY getting poor medical treatment for pretty run of the mill depression...I was in Silicon Valley at the time and over 30 and female. There was NO space for me to be anything less that 120% perfect as I was one of very few women working in SV at the time."
1327;depends
1328;
1329;It has nothing to do with the future job responsibilities 
1330;It may cause them to think I won't be able to perform at my job 100%.
1331;It would depend on what the job duties were and how comfortable the person interviewing made me feel.
1332;Depends on relevancy to the job.
1333;To make sure that appropriate accommodations could be made. 
1334;
1335;Worried about how they will look at me after
1336;
1337;Depends on potential impact on job
1338;As it may inhibit my chances of getting the position.
1339;it's important that a potential employer has a full idea of you as a potential employee to make an informed decision
1340;I'd feel that it'd make me less apt for the job I'm applying in comparison to others.
1341;Although I know in some places employers are not supposed to discriminate against candidates due to ability status, some still do. If and only if it were something that would require significant accommodations or if it was a visible disability, like a wheelchair, would I bring it up.
1342;I fear of receiving negative responses
1343;I wouldn't want to attach a negative stigma to myself during an interview
1344;
1345;Deafness can be viewed as a physical health issue, and not many employers are willing to go out of their way to accommodate that.
1346;If it's going to impede my ability to work, sure
1347;It might affect my performance
1348;"As I don't suffer from anything particularly serious it's hard to imagine, but if I did I feel more as if I would be compelled to state this; as if it was likely to affect my ability to work I would want to be upfront about it. If it didn't affect my ability to work I might avoid mentioning it straight away to mitigate the chance of negative concequences"
1349;To be upfront about any time off
1350;
1351;Bias towards something that may not be relevant to the work
1352;An employer should know any limitations you have.
1353;they might think that i am not capable to work. I am also a migrant and this is adds up.
1354;If it would effect my performance
1355;Fear of negative impact on prospects of employment.
1356;
1357;
1358;Physical health has less of a stigma.
1359;It may affect how I work
1360;Would depend entirely on the attitude of the person on the other side of the table
1361;
1362;Risk of discrimination
1363;I would only bring up the physical health issue if it would have an effect on my performance at work. 
1364;I probably wouldn't get the job if I mentioned my physical issues.
1365;If my physical health affects productivity or accessibility, it will be important to discuss this with potential employer.
1366;I consider this private and protected information that should only be given if absolutely needed. I want to be able to control if and when the employer is able to use this information.
1367;The concept is tangible, unavoidable, and not something really hidden. 
1368;While it would be illegal to discriminate, but theres something in the back of my mind that if I say anything about it they will look for another excuse to not hire you.
1369;This is all a point of basic surviving. If I had problems to bring food to my table or pay for rent in case I don't get the job I would keep my mouth shut and work as hard as I can. If not, like the case is now, I would take the liberty of trying to get the most comfortable work position. It is easy to ask for your rights and better work environment when basic life needs are met and are safe regardless of your work. In case they are not, then you don't have the liberty of emotions, problems, sickness and what not, you have to survive and you do what you have to do it. 
1370;
1371;Unless it affected my ability to do my job, I would not bring it up. If it did, I would only bring it up as late as possible.
1372;I wouldn't want it to hinder my chances of getting a job if I didn't think a physical health issue was related to the job.
1373;i currently do not have any physical issues. 
1374;If it was relevant and not a stigmatized condition. 
1375;It would depend on the tone of the interviewer and the attitude of the individual that was interviewing me
1376;If it's an obvious disability, then there's no need to bring it up. If it's not obvious, then it isn't their concern.
1377;Because my working environment might require improvement or at least adaptation like a lighter place/bigger screen/special desk. I think this conversation will be receive normal. Or at least as normal as speaking about money and advantages.
1378;They would rather hire me someone who isn't sick
1379;I don't want it held against me
1380;There isn't stigma
1381;"I would. My previous employees have been very aware of the of the legal protections afforded to candidates and employees with physical impairments, temporary or permanent, and act accordingly. These issues are regarded as ""real"", and tend to have more predictable timelines with regard to recovery (if applicable)."
1382;
1383;If its is relevant.
1384;Depends on the physical issue and/or the position being applied for.
1385;
1386;If it could affect work, I might bring it up.
1387;It would depend on the health issue and whether it could require accommodations.
1388;It's easy to see and prove.
1389;I don't see the point in disclosure of things that should not be requested without violating employment law.
1390;Things like Asthma or access to buildings are socially 'acceptable' to mention in these situations.
1391;the world isn't an ideal place, sometimes it is more important to get in the door and ask for forgiveness later than permission up front
1392;If it affected my ability to work, then yes. 
1393;"A place where I need to look and sound my best doesn't seem like the time to mention that I have something ""disordered"" about me."
1394;Let's be realistic, it would harm my career.
1395;If it were an issue that could be helped by an accommodation, but didn't rise to the level of a protected disability, and having the accommodation or not would swing my decision to work at the company
1396;
1397;It depends on the issue and how it affects the job. If it was 100% unnecessary I'd keep it to myself.
1398;If they have an issue with it, it likely a sign of a place I wouldn't want to work. 
1399;
1400;In an interview, I would be afraid to reveal anything that could be seen as a detriment that was not otherwise necessary to disclose.
1401;
1402;May not get the job depending on the physical issue. 
1403;
1404;It's fairly obvious/straightforward, a physical health issue will, in most cases, be visible within the workplace.
1405;I believe that it wouldn't affect the outcome
1406;
1407;Even with physical health issues, I should be able  to do my work. 
1408;Weakens my negotiation position.
1409;Depending on how 'safe' I'm made to feel during the interview process I might feel it might reflect badly which, if I really *needed* the job I might not want to risk.
1410;"Risk of being discarded at a job interview.
Risk of being neglected of a promotion.
Risk of being fired."
1411;"They might call it a ""culture fit"" issue"
1412;to get accomodation
1413;I would probably not bring up a physical health issue because it's most likely not relevant to my ability to perform my job.
1414;
1415;
1416;
1417;Might reduce my chances of getting hired, even though I don't expect them to ever officially name it as a reason for my application being turned down.
1418;Bringing up such an issue can only decrease your chances of employment. However, I don't feel it would have a strong effect in my line of work.
1419;Not relevant to my job
1420;I don't know (sorry)
1421;I might not get the job then... 
1422;I guess if I had an issue hard enough that it would affect my work, I'd be worried about the perception I could not do the job.  
1423;It depends on the type of issue. If it was something common, then I would be more likely as I feel as though they would be more willing to accommodate me.
1424;If they asked me directly, I would tell them, but I wouldn't want to ruin my chances of getting the job.
1425;
1426;
1427;I would be afraid it would reflect poorly on me.
1428;I believe my health information is my personal business
1429; QF
1430;Fear that doing so would cause the employer to factor in additional health insurance expense.
1431;Stigma with some diseases
