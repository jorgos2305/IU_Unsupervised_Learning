;Why or why not?.1

1;While mental health has become a more prominent issue recently, I feel like there is still a lot of stigma surrounding it. At this point, with our culture, I would not bring it up. I hope that within the next 20-30 years that stigma will be gone and it can be brought up safely in an interview.
2;Stigma, mainly. 
3;would not if I was not 100% sure that the disclosure would not affect my application
4;I don't know
5;It would depend on the field & what I knew of the employer.
6;I want to gauge their ability to support, understand and empathize with my situation.
7;Same reason.
8;Only if I felt I required accommodation. Even then, reluctantly because it makes me a less attractive candidate.
9;It really depends on the person, the employer, and how comfortable I felt discussing the issue.
10;Same reason as above.
11;It isn't relevant to my ability as a programmer.
12;Also seems highly likely to be irrelevant at the point that I am in an interview. 
13;Too private.
14;Because Of the potential for discrimination
15;I don't think it's appropriate to discuss those issues during early interviews. I'd wait to discuss with HR after I have a feel for what's going on.
16;I have found their reaction to be a good indicator of whether our ideals are aligned / whether it's a good fit for me as a workplace.
17;
18;bad idea 
19;Stigmatized. Uncomfortable for both parties. Mental instability frowned upon in technical roles. 
20;I feel it would definitely affect my chances at being accepted.
21;I don't have any
22;
23;I feel like this would put you out of the running for a position almost immediately. Or at least be used as a negative mark against you.
24;Again, only if it could effect my job performance
25;
26;Same reason as above.
27;
28;I think most employers would straight up discount me for that
29;See above
30;Depending on the exact nature of the issue I might think they wouldn't want to hire me
31;Seems unnecessary. It's asinine to bring up unnecessary conversation ever. 
32;Again, when properly coped with it shouldn't affect my ability to do the job. I expect, as with physical health issues, I'll be allowed time needed when coping is necessary.
33;Same as before 
34;It's no different from a physical health issue. If it can potentially affect my performance then I should be clear.
35;same as before
36;Same answer as for physical health issues, though admittedly I'm a little slower to bring up mental health concerns due to stigma fears.
37;
38;
39;Because my employer needs to support me in order to get the best work possible from me
40;In most regards it doesn't concern the employer, if it becomes an issue then I'd be willing to discuss it.
41;For me, it depends on how the interview is going - if it's clear that it's a dead end, I would not bring it up.
42;Too easy to map mental health to ability to do the job.
43;
44;
45;Seems like it would deter them from hiring me.
46;"I think the only time would be with ""on call"" work (i.e. Being available 24/7 with no set schedule) as this causes far too much stress in my life. I refuse, and have quit, jobs that rely on this method. The job that I quit was promised to have a schedule in the interview. "
47;There's likely nothing they could do to mitigate any performance problems as a result of a mental health issue, so I probably wouldn't discuss. 
48;Would want to know if management support is going to work.
49;Not related to my qualifications or skills
50;
51;
52;mental issues are a bit stigmatic, everyone knows it's there but no-one wants to deal with it. A broken leg isn't that big a deal, but a broken mind is abstract.
53;I understand that, while they might consciously not act differently if I had a mental health issue, I'm not at all convinced that people in tech, even those who know what Cognitive Dissonance means, will actually take steps to avoid it.  Furthermore, there's a huge stigma behind it.
54;Because, if it were a mental health issue that might affect my job performance, it may be easy to hide, while being forthcoming about it might impact my likelihood to get the job in the first place.
55;Same reasons. 
56;
57;
58;The stigma of the topic.
59;If it got in the way of work, it if I needed some accommodation, I would, but, otherwise, it wouldn't seem worth it.
60;same thing: If it has impact or if it's visible at work, why trying to hide.
61;If it would have a direct impact on my ability to perform the role I would feel compelled to mention it, but depending on how understanding I expected the employer to I might not, due to the negative consequences. 
62;
63;Won't get the job. 
64;Disclosing that cannot help you get the job
65;
66;
67;Interviews are largely about knowledge / mental capacity. Could be seen as a weaker mental capacity.
68;
69;It should not effect they way how I work. So it should not have any negative things for the new boss
70;Only if it would affect my work somehow
71;Might have negative influence on getting a job or not
72;Could only hurt my chances
73;Again: honesty.
74;I feel uncomfortable discussing such issues with someone I've just met.
75;Don't know, feeling
77;"It's a weakness; and you mostly want to talk about your strenghts"
78;I don't think companies are able or willing to deal with a mental health issue. I feel like bringing it up Cottle negatively affect the decision to hire me. 
79;Again, to ensure that the employer is not going to turn out to be unsupportive of employee needs.
80;I wouldn't know whether it would affect chances of getting employed.
81;I don't think they would hire me, in the first place.
82;Only if I felt it would impact my productivity
83;If it relates to schedule availability, etc.  (Eg, can't work during certain hours, need frequent breaks, etc.)
84;
85;I would bring up any issue that would affect my performance of that jobs duties 
86;Mental health is still viewed as a taboo.
87;I would be worried that it might affect my job application even though I am aware that they are not legally allowed to do so. However, it would be difficult to determine / prove if that was the case or not.
88;
89;Because it can be seen as a weakness and they may chose another applicant over me because of it.
90;Not sure how the employer would see the problem there's no information available for them or on the mental problems and how to deal with it.
91;bias
92;Stigma
93;Same response as the physical one.
94;
95;"My mental health issues are manageable outside
Of work, mostly, so I don't bring them up "
96;Same as with the physical.
97;Again it's not a situation I've experienced so I think it would depend on the health issue and how comfortable I was with the potential employer.
98;
99;They wouldn't hire me
100;"Same as before; lack of worker protections and proof that non-hire was result of disclosure of condition"
101;Stigma.
102;If it was relevant to the position. 
103;Same answer as before. I prefer to use an interview as an opportunity to learn more about a potential employer and to showcase my skills. I wouldn't want to waste that valuable time on the minutiae of my health.
104;It _could_ way into being hired, instead of skills
105;I cannot see how sharing this information would benefit me.
106;I don't have anything diagnosed specifically wrt my anxiety and depression.  Sometimes I don't take it as seriously because of that.
107;"If I was ""recovered"""
108;I imagine that would prompt the interviewers to quickly disregard my resume.
109;Again, if relevant to the work hours or similar.
110;I am to the point in my career that if cannot be honest with my employer, then I don't want to work for them.
111;None of their business
112;Same reasons.  Doubt that interviewer would be able to avoid bias.
114;I suffer from burn-outs. If I'm ever willing to work for an employer again, this is something they need to be aware of in order to find the best way to avoid it.
115;Would want them to know in case of potential impact on my work.  But would be hesitant due to possible stigma associated with it 
116;Depends on the vibe and the type of work.
117;
118;My internalized stigma is way too strong. 
119;
120;Because I wouldn't want to work for an employer who wouldn't hire someone with such a condition
121;"I think there is a general feeling of ""you should be able to manage that"" via some employers and this is not where I would want to test that. I might bring up mental health coverage during an interview though."
122;
123;Are you serious right now? I would never in a million years discuss my mental health issues. I don't need my new employers judging me off the bat and having a reason to not give me the job because someone equally qualified who doesn't over share and talk about their problems is given the job instead of me. I also am lucky that work is a place where I often function better than I do at home. Personally, I do better when I don't allow myself the option to give into depressive episodes at work. But that's just my experience. I've worked at companies where my supervisor knew I was dealing with depression and addiction recovery and it didn't help me at all. He didn't understand and I made it easier for myself to slack off. At my new job I haven't told anyone and Even though I think they'd be more supportive and understanding, I feel better that I keep my personal issues out of the work place. Though I understand completely that other people who have mental health issues are not as lucky to be as functional as I am. 
124;It would likely result in a negative opinion of me, and my ability to perform the job, and might also be communicated beyond the person performing the interview. It's not a potential employers business if it doesn't effect my ability to do the job, and I value my privacy.
125;I assume that chronic mental health issues, like chronic physical health issues, would often affect hiring decisions, even though employers won't say so.  I'm diabetic, and have observed discrimination on the physical health side of things.
126;It's a very personal thing, to talk about a mental health issue. It is harder to talk about because it forces me to tell you something that you otherwise might never know, unlike a physical ailment which could be visible or become visible over time without my consenting to share it. 
127;Because it would impact the relationship (I might need certain freedom or personal space for example) and I believe honesty up front to be the best approach.
128;Same reason, if it does not affect my job skills, interviewer does not need to know. Otherwise, I might tell about it. 
129;I don't want to get passed over. 
130;Afraid to add something negative to the balance sheet
131;There is zero upside to bringing it up. There is no foreseeable circumstance in which bringing it up forestalls a problem or leads to opportunity.
132;It carries a stigma
133;I would be afraid it would jeopardize my chances
134;Would only bring it up if it affected my ability to do the job.
135;Again, unless it somehow directly impacts my work it's nobody's business
136;I think it could negatively impact my candidacy for the position.
137;Depends on the issue at hand. Would it affect my performance or would it require adjustments? Then, yes. If not, then I probably wouldn't.
138;Never. Absolutely never. This would be stigmatized to hell. 
139;"Same as above. Things like ""please send an agenda w/HR meetings, because anxiety"" usually come up after hire, not at interview time, IME"
140;Jeopardizes getting the job
141;I do not want health issues to effect how I am perceived in an interview.
142;Risk of not getting an offer
143;may not get hired
144;I'm already deaf. I have a lot working against me in the interview process already.  
145;Because it's none of their business. 
146;"Mental health issues are hugely stigmatized.  I made the mistake of letting my last employer find out that I had ADHD and an adderall prescription not really thinking about it.  The head of engineering would joke about me ""doing meth"" after that at horrible moments including me (I have no degree) interviewing a PhD candidate who had done groundbreaking work in SMP and threaded rendering at SGI in the 90s and was all around awesome.  Luckily he made a joke about not talking about the shrooms he did to lighten that one, but there were many worse situations.  I was considered one of the most valued employees because of my ability to get anything done with the LLVM compiler system.  One day I pointed out to the manager in question that he was on a higher dosage of the same medication I was on, and the stupid meth jokes got worse from there.  It's not really a light accusation to make on somebody given our country's state of drug law, something which I am something of an activist for reform of.  It was was degrading. I was also made fun of for being autistic despite that not being a disorder I have.  "
147;As above, but with added stigma that mental health issues are seen as not serious (and therefore bringing it up is itself would be considered a problem), or as incurable and therefore at least as big a liability as a physical problem.
148;
149;
150;
151;It depends on the reputation of the employer
152;Would not get hired
153;I would be reluctant to bring up a mental health issue for fear that it could reduce my chances of getting the job.
154;There is absolutely no way it could help, and a lot lot lot of ways it could hurt. And even though I should be protected by non-discrimination laws, if someone did use it in their decision-making, I'd have virtually no recourse.
155;
156;
157;
158;Not their business
159;Could contribute to employment decision (legal or not) 
160;It would be judged as a risk.
161;They might think I'm a complainer
162;None of their business as long as I feel I can perform my work 
163;Supervisors don't like to deal with those sort of issues.
164;"Potentially frowned upon
"
165;
166;Only if it is relevant for the work.
167;
168;If it impacts the work, they should know about it.
169;
170;I'm not sure if it'd harm my chances, but I wouldn't want to give anyone more reason to not hire me
171;Would be concerned at the negative stigma
172;Stigma.
173;
174;
175;I feel it would negatively effect my ability to get the position
176;
177;I would be afraid it would negatively impact my chances.
178;I would want to set expectations of my ability from the start
179;
180;It might be important to know how they react to such things.
181;depends if it's relevant
182;Usually not relevant
183;It's none of their business until it affects my work
184;That is a slippery slope. In my opinion your chances of getting the job are much less if you bring up mental health issues.
185;I don't have one, so it's hard to relate
186;Concern it could overshadow other issues
187;I would likely prefer to wait until the offer stage to discuss mental health issue / accommodations, rather than in the interview
188;same
189;Wouldn't want marks against me
190;
191;It depends on how open the potential employer is about mental health
192;
193;
194;If it would make me seem less suitable for the job
195;I'd worry that the reaction would not be one of understanding and that it would count against me during the selection process.
196;
197;It hard. There is still a stigma around mental health problems and people faking it, certainly around my home town.
198;
199;I would not because I am very concerned that it would negatively affect my chances for employment.
200;I wouldn't bring it up unless absolutely necessary for my day-to-day job function, out of fear of discrimination or not being hired.
201;Same as physical health reason really. Coupled with the fact that nowadays I feel it's even more important to highlight mental health issues rather than sweeping under the carpet.
202;
203;Because I am open about being a mental health advocate - it's one of the reasons I am good at my job.
204;Stigma.
205;if it wasn't relevant
206;
207;Again, wouldn't want it to be held against me compared to other candidates.
208;
209;Same reason as above
210;
211;Depends on whether or not I feel it would impact my ability to do the work on a regular basis.
212;Stigma.
213;
214;Same reason, it may affect my productivity.
215;
216;
217;Yes, If can affect work
218;
219;cos I have a lot of crap in my head and i am ashamed about it
220;I like to be open about it up front 
221;
222;Only if it required immediate accommodation.
223;Less chances of getting the job, plus negative references for the future.
224;Mental health is still stigmatised enough and not protected enough it could result in my not getting a job I wanted.
225;Seems too private to share
226;I imagine they will dismiss my application
227;I don't know if I would do that. 
228;Not sure. That would depend a lot on the company I would be interviewing with.
229;same reason as above. it's my problem and my business alone.
230;They absolutely do not need to know this before i start. I feel like this is a huge HR issue and the less they know the better honestly. I am very dyslexic  and  have a learning disability but it does not effect how i preform at my job
231;I prefer to keep nothing hidden
232;
233;Stigma.
234;Feel it would prevent hire. Only if asked point blank.
235;Same as any issue, I'm looking for employers that enjoy me exactly as I am. Not some glossed up version of myself
236;depending of the place and the mental health issue ...
237;
238;Has the potential to look like you are whining.
239;It might affect my performance and relations with the colleagues
240;
241;If the employer made it clear they expected crunch time I would want to discuss stress related issues. 
242;I'm already a minority in tech, definitely wouldn't get the job if also sick 
243;
244;
245;I'd be concerned that it would negatively affect my employment opportunity.
246;Because they wouldn't employ you
247;I wouldn't want to knowingly generate bias against me in an interview.
248;I want to get hired
249;uncertainty about their reaction
250;Fear of discrimination.
251;Even with more education on mental health, there is still a stigma and negative outcome in the work place if one is known to be 'on medication'.
252;I need to establish trust with my employer before I would be willing to discuss my mental health, especially if it was not actively affecting my work performance at the time of the interview.
253;No one wants to hire a crazy person
254;It might make them doubt my reliability or performance, and so be less likely to hire me.
255;Only if got ask
256;I worry it would affect my chances of employment
257;Naturally, I'd be afraid that they wouldn't hire me.
258;
259;I would not want to appear weak or unstable.
260;"Again, check my baggage at the door. My ADHD and general anxiety are well-managed enough that most of the time, they'll never have to worry about it anyway. At the same time, I'm proactive about bringing it up at my current gig, because I don't want it to be a ""new thing"" if I'm suddenly in a bad way."
261;
262;Same as above
263;See above
264;
265;Stigma
266;The stigma of mental illness is something that I am not sure I feel most employers would be willing to look past in an interview. I'm already a woman, which some view as a burden (will she need to leave for childcare? is she as capable of this job as her male counterparts?) and adding the additional 'burden' of having a mental health issue seems like it'd stack the cards against me.
267;Never know what they will do with that information
268;Because the employer would use it to measure how competent/high maintenance I was
269;
270;
271;
272;I'd have to feel it out in the interview and see if I felt comfortable discussing it. It's a tough call. I wish I could just feel comfortable doing it all the time. 
273;See previous.
274;suspect it would  stop  me  getting  job
275;
276;I feel as if there is a stigma against mental health issues in general. I am loathe to even discuss it with my wife.
277;
278;I wouldn't know if I needed accommodations. Also shame. Probably more shame.
279;I'd only bring it up if I felt comfortable & also would need accommodations. But probably a lot less likely to bring it up than a physical health issue.
280;My problem to work with, not theirs
281;Personal health issues don't belong in the interview process, as it inherently makes the interview particularly hostile to the interviewee and their organization (because HR law, especially as relating to anti-discrimination, is a thing).
282;Mental health issues are still a taboo subject.
283;
284;Fear of discrimination 
285;It's my problem, not theirs.
286;because it gets equated with mental competency and makes you look bad
287;If I thought that it was relevant to the job I was interviewing for, I would bring it up.
288;Fear of discrimination
289;
290;depends if I feel comfortable enough
291;
292;
293;It's not of their business
294;It would affect their decision regardless of policy 
295;
296;I believe there would be a conscious/unconscious bias against me.
297;I often do not disclose.
298;There is mental health issues in my family
299;Would feel it may have an effect on the chance of employment
300;it would depend on the severity of the condition, and to what extent it would affect my capability to work
301;It may affect the hiring managers decision if I bring this up. Although, an interview is about ensuring the employer is a good fit for me too. So I would have to consider my options at the time.
302;
303;Mental health is not seen as an issue by most employers.
304;Mental health is either not taken as seriously as physical health or is viewed negatively.
305;It _may_ affect the outcome of an interview, so I'd be reluctant to bring it up
306;I need to know they understand. I don't want to work for someone who doesn't understand.
307;I don't think I need it.
308;Would be too much of a negative
309;My physical health problems are less stigmatized. 
310;none of their business unless it actively limits my activities, at which point I probably wouldn't be interviewing anyway
311;very much depends on what the line of questioning leading to that was and the nature of their line of enquiry
312;
313;There is still too much stigma attached to mental health and the possibility for discrimination is too high. I might disclose it *after* being hired and passing any probationary period. 
314;
315;I have enough counting against me in an interview without adding to the number of biases weighted against me.
316;I depends on what degree it affects my work. If it affects how I work I would want to be up front about that.
317;Could definitely be seen as a weakness and a reason why you wouldn't be as productive as someone without the issue.
318;Would only hurt you
319;It's not relevant to my ability to perform the job responsibilities.
320;Don't have one personally, but the same logic applies. Mental health isn't respected or understood well by anyone and I don't see how it would be to my advantage to disclose.
321;If it was going to effect my position, I would bring it up.
322;
323;Again, it would depend on the relevance. If a mental health issue would in any way effect my life at a the potential job, I would much rather be upfront about my needs and requirements from my employers than try to hide it. If I thought it was irrelevant to the job, I probably wouldn't bring it up during an interview.
324;
325;Only if I had a firm belief that there would be no negative consequences.
326;I would be afraid that it would result in me not being chosen for the position.
327;Like i said before, i think that there are so many prejudices and ignorance about mental health
328;I am from India. IMO mental illness is not looked upon in an accepting way here. If I have an mental health issue, I would be skeptical to talk about it as it might affect my prospects.
329;i would not want to give ANY reason for disqualification
330;I am scared it may scare off potential employers to be honest. I guess it really depends on the person that is sitting across the table and how comfortable I'd feel.
331;The stigma associated with mental health colors the judgement of potential candidates.  
332;For all the reasons you already know.
333;
334;Concern about it's impact on hiring
335;For the same reason.  If it effects my work, they need to know.
336;I don't think mental health issues are well understood and the negative stigma might cause my interview to end negatively
337;I would say it depends on what it is. Generally speaking, I would be hesitant to bring up any mental health issue in an interview situation, but there are circumstances which could change my mind.
338;Same as above
339;Same, depends on the relevance to my function
341;It could mean time off/etc and the employer should be infomred
342;
343;Seems irrelevant and embarrassing
344;I would not want to work for an employer that reacted negatively to a mental health issue. I think it's a good test to ensure that they're the kind of employer I'd want to work for. 
345;I think a potential employer would definitely see a mental health issue as a reason not to hire me.
346;employers may see it as a cost
347;Unsure
348;It depends on whether or not it would affect my job.
349;Could compromise my ability to get hired or look like a compelling candidate
350;Many organizations look for any reason to reject a candidate during the interview process.
351;It should not have an impact on my interview process.
352;Too great a stigma. Would likely be rejected for another candidate. 
353;If the issue affected my work, I would want the employer to know about it at the time of hiring, to avoid conflict later.
354;If it does not affect my work, it is none of their business.
355;I feel like bringing up a mental health issue would be a mark against me getting the job. If they had the choice between myself and another candidate that didn't mention a health issue, I feel they would take the other candidate.
356;
357;I worry that it would be viewed as a very severe weakness.
358;Discrimination.
359;Judgement
360;Only when it was relevant
361;same as above
362;A perception/assumption of automatic and immediate disqualification. 
363;I barely know these people, probably, and I'd rather not give them any reasons to turn me down. I don't see an upside.
364;
365;
366;circumstantial 
367;It's important to know ahead of time.
368;As for physical issues, I do not feel it is relevant to employment.
369;
370;Same reason as physical health -- it's very personal.
371;Honesty
372;"It depends on the employer. See, it's difficult to answer survey questions that require generalizing all previous employers. I've had productive conversations with some; even so, at one place a mental health issue conversation resulted in immediate retribution."
373;Again, if it affected my direct functioning I probably would. I'm quite reserved anyway, and unless it could affect my work directly, it's not my employer's business.
374;Social stigma 
375;Uncertain about reception.  Very difficult to determine an interviewer's experience and perception of mental illness.
376;Health issues (either physical or mental) do not affect my productivity as a worker while I am in the «working» state (i.e. not absent due to some illness), so why should I discuss them in an interview?
377;Rather not bring up something that would affect my chances of being hired. (Yes, it's illegal to discriminate that way, but that doesn't mean that doesn't happen, yeah?)
378;I have several severe mental health issues that would greatly affect my work.
379;Medical screening process would be more appropriate (even though some of them only ask for diagnosed mental illnesses) 
380;It is what it is. If that causes a problem, I should not work there.
381;I don't think it would help my chances of getting the job, and it's possible that it could hurt them.
382;If it didn't affect my job, I would discuss it with my manager after I was hired
383;I don't think that's a topic that needs to be discussed in an interview.
384;Same reason as physical health - it's not their business straight up, so maybe in a later interview
385;Quick way to not get the job.
386;
387;May affect job performance.
388;Mental illness is not a protected class from discrimination and disclosing it publicly could affect my immigration status
389;They may not be accepting
390;discrimination 
391;
392;
393;None of their business.
394;"If it's relevant to the conversation, I'm happy to mention that I'm an anxious depressive and to expand as needed. I think it's important to raise the topic openly (as appropriate); it reduces stigma, and gives me an indication of the company's attitude towards mental health."
395;same as above
396;negative connotation
397;As the solicitant, its not my responsibitliy to do so. I dont know the company's terms and culture about this and would feel uncomfortable discussing it.
398;"I think there's a stigma around mental health and also an issue of trust. I don't want to share with someone who will violate that trust (a physical disability is more transparent than a mental one), and also deemed ""more dangerous"" to the workplace. "
399;Same as with a physical health issue, I take on jobs I can do, mutually agreeing on parameters (they need it done soon, I need enough flexibility to deal with mental and/or physical issues).
400;
401;Might mean no offer.
402;
403;Depends on the issue — depression has a stigma.
404;Fear of being rejected or discriminated
405;Privacy
406;If it's relevant or would affect my duties. For example, if I was in a situation where I would need my team to be aware of my condition to help me deal with an acute episode then I would make sure that my team is properly equipped to do so.
407;pretty sure this would not work out in my favor
408;Because while discriminating for mental health is not legal, one never gets reasons for a job offer not being extended, so it can only hinder.
409;Same as above.
410;Same as above -- hesitant to bring up anything that doesn't affect my work but might make me seem less employable.
411;General sense of stigma.
412;No need to disclose so early as it may not be an issue. Don't want to give them a reason not to pick me!
413;Not the right sotuation to talk about a mental issue
414;
415;Depends on the amount of open view on it
416;Because I would be scared they would think that it affects my work and I'm not worth hiring.
417;It's hard to talk about in that high pressure situation
418;
419;I wouldn't because for fear of not being hired because of it, but at the same time I feel like I should It may affect my availability to perform my job
420;
421;Not relevant
422;I wouldn't want to work for an employer who couldn't handle the fact that I (or any coworkers) might have a health issue.
423;No reason to risk making them concerned about it
424;Same, although would have greater concern about employer viewing mental health as worse that a physical health issue as well as overall negative views of mental health issues. 
425;Unknown ramifications. 
426;
427;
428;if relevant to job
429;I want to be considered the same as every other applicant, and not be categorized by my limitations.
430;Again, if the employer stated their position on mental health issues and support for potential employees then I would feel comfortable talking about it.
431;Afraid of niet being understood, that makes it hard to talk about it. Especially during an interview.
432;I wouldn't know if I could trust them at that stage
433;I personally don't believe that generalized employers have the capacity to grapple with the possibility or potential for any mental health issues when they are worried about keeping their companies afloat.
434;Would not wish to prejudice the interview process
435;
436;The same as previous one.
437;I don't think enough people are aware of mental health issues, so it is more likely to just have a negative impact
438;Is it relevant to the job, and is it something I can work around.
439;
440;Interview is not the place/time for personal info
441;BECAUSE
442;Since it doesn't affect my job performance it's none of their business.
443;If it seemed relevant.
444;Same reason, basically. And, it seems like it might be too early in a relationship to do so.  Why should they have a window into my personal life, just because they're my employers?
445;
446;Fear of discrimination as a racial minority with a mental health issue
447;
448;Worried about discrimination
449;
451;For the same reason as above, but I don't know at all whether the employer views mental health the same as physical health.
452;Keeping it secret is essential to getting & holding jobs at some companies.
453;Afraid of the stigma
454;I'm lucky that I'm mostly functional even when not doing well so I wouldn't disclose until I was at the company and had a better idea of how people react to it. 
455;
456;Why risk implicit or overt bias?
457;Because I fear repercussions including not being hired
458;Because of the nature of our work, mental health issues are far more impactful. If I thought it needed to be accounted for, I would involve the potential employer to ensure they can work with me.
459;I know there's widespread stigma toward mental health. I would avoid discussion this in an interview (unless I didn't want the job)
460;taboo 
461;Stigma could influence their desire to hire me. 
462;That's sensitive, and I'd need to know them better first.
463;
464;Would be afraid that it would negatively affect my potential as a hiring candidate.
465;
466;I feel that it would only hurt my chances at employment, or have no bearing at all.
467;
468;Most people tend to assume that being mentally ill means you're going to be crap writing code.
469;I'd rather ask about health benefits and look at it from there.  No need to bring it up in an interview unless it directly affects the job, or is specifically brought up by the interviewer
470;It would depend on my general feelings of the employer/my issue
471;
472;See above answer - related to trust.
473;This would depend on the severity of an effect the issue could have on work performance.
474;I would bring it up if it affected day to day work. Otherwise probably would not because the stigma around it.
475;Also irrelevant to getting  a job.
476;
477;I don't see the need. If I'm at the interview, it's because I am fine working there as I am.
478;
479;I wouldn't feel comfortable discussing mental health issues with anybody but really close friends and/or other sufferers in the first place. But also, it's not like it wouldn't hurt my chances of landing a position.
480;I'm uncertain how the ADA applies to mental health, or whether it even applies at all
481;
482;a
483;I would if I felt it would be a serious impediment to both parties as it pertains to my ability to do the job. Otherwise it could feel a bit like trapping the employer.
484;Depend on the job
485;Fear that it would disqualify me in their mind.
486;Same as above.
487;because it hurts me
488;Reaction would tell a lot of the type of employer they are. 
489;If was relevant to the job, then yes. But I do think that discussing mental health in a job interview is more risky (because of the negative perception it could create) than discussing physical health issues.
490;I feel that a mental health issue would not be something I'd want them to take into account as part of the hiring process, unless it were a serious enough issue that I wouldn't want to work for an employer who was not willing to make accommodations for my issue.
491;They are still stigmatized and without obvious mentions of acceptance by the employer beforehand I would worry that there would be hidden (or not so hidden) prejudice.  Again I would worry about being written off for the job.
492;Depression is my entire life. Work shouldn't be my life.
493;It has no legal bearing on the hiring process
494;Not having a mental illness, I assume there is a stigma around the issue for people who haven't experienced it.
495;
496;I would discuss a mental health issue only at an interview that is trending towards an offer, mostly to review what mental health covered their insurance provides.
497;I would be worried that it would hinder my chances as a potential candidate
498;It's a market
499;"Work mostly in small teams: no-one would consider you and small teams could excuse it away as ""not a good personality fit"""
500;"Mental health issues don't seem to be treated like ""real"" issues"
501;I wont get the job
502;"Might allude to it under the guise of ""work-life balance"" or something, but the only valid reason to hire me is the quality of my brain so it would be extremely detrimental to call it into question"
503;
504;
505;I have been hospitalized twice at Hines Madden Hospital. This issue is a bridge too far to cross.  Been out of full-time work since let go Jan 2010. Trying to get back in in next two years. Working part-time installing systems. Was a sys admin.
506;
507;I may not bring up a mental health issue in an interview with a potential employer, because I would be afraid that it might influence their decision about whether or not to hire me. They might view me as unstable or unqualified to properly do my job.
508;I actually don't think it's any of their business.
509;Same as physical. 
510;I definitely think the employer might worry about my ability to perform the job.
512;
513;See above
514;Not unless I knew what their track record was with mental illness, I would have to know I could trust them and that they wouldn't judge me negatively
515;Getting through interview would be hard enough, let alone risk negative response
516;Same reason mostly. Though probably depend on particular issue and how it may affect the work life
517;I would bring it up because I think it's not right to hide it, even for yourself, you could have an increased stress from trying to hide the disorder which could make your disorder even worse than it should be. Also if a company isn't willing to hire you because you suffer from a mental disorder, it's probably a company you wouldn't want to work for.
518;Same as physical -- if I think I would need special treatment or accommodation to do the work, I would bring it up as soon as it's relevant.  
519;I think they would not hire me if they knew I had depression issues.
520;I'd bet they wouldn't hire me
521;Mental health issues can and often do effect our ability to perform.
522;"They would immediately give the ""short interview"" and show you the door. That's career suicide. What if someone said ""I'm manic depressive, sometimes I can't get shit done because I'm too depressed. Other times I'll get more done in 4 hours than your entire team will in a week."" Most companies are going to think you're nuts."
523;Because as a techie your main  tool is your brain. And i would fear that people would see my mental health issue as a maldunction and value my abilities less
524;It doesn't matter at that point in my opinion. Ultimately I feel, although third parties can greatly help you with mental health troubles, it is ultimately yourself and your perspective on things that has to change and thus it's a very personal battle.
525;Now you've got me...! I think not previously knowing said interviewers would dissuade me, not knowing how it would affect my outcome, although I would know that I should be addressing it with them.
526;Would go against me
527;Not everybody understands mental health. Would worry about being perceived negatively. 
528;Too personal
529;I think it is generally important to bring it up, if I felt that the employer was open to hearing about it
530;
531;Feeling vulnerable, not wanting to let them down
532;Embarrassing / personal issue
533;
534;Again, depends on whether I thought it would impact performance, and would require accommodation.
535;I don't feel comfortable talking about mental health issues at all, even less with a stranger interviewing me.
536;It would be a weird thing to volunteer in an interview. I wouldn't want a candidate to tell me about any issue, because it puts me in a bad spot if I decline to offer them a job.
537;It's not pertinent to the position..
538;I don't know them, and they don't know me
539;
540;I want to make sure both parties can make an informed decision - leaving something important unsaid would foster frustrated expectations
541;Reduce chance for employment
542;With the best will in the world an employer will not see it as a positive even if it's not direct discrimination.
543;To be honest and up front about things that may affect my work performance, unless I was too embarrassed to talk about it. 
544;Again, it depends on if it would strongly affect my ability to work
545;This is quiet personal
547;
548;
549;Same as above, and there are additional implications about mental health and overall group dynamics.
550;never have done it before
551;
552;I assume it would weigh against me getting the job
553;
554;There's a stigma, so I'd probably leave it out if I could.
555;Stigma
556;I wouldn't think it relevant to the interview.
557;This again would negatively reflect on your potential, especially more so that a physical problem.
558;No because I don't want them to think I can't perform my job or that they can't count on me in crunch time.
559;I would not bring up a mental health issue, but if they brought it up, I would talk about it.
560;Same reason as a physical health issue.
561;"Mental health issues that impact my job are necessary for them to know for them to make an informed decision. This would probably change to ""no"" if I NEEDED the job as opposed to just wanted the job."
562;Only if it would directly affect my work, otherwise it's not their business.
564;It hasn't come up for me.
565;xxx
566;They won't employ me
567;Same reason. Could cause trouble to keep silent.
568;
569;Even though it's unjustified there is a stigma attached to mental health issues that is just not there for physical limitations.
570;I doubt they'd hire me.
571;
572;Depends on the issue.
573;I would want to know the stance of the potential employer towards mental health issues. There is still a stigma surrounding mental health issues, and while it needs to dissipate, I would want to know the context in which I would bring it up and more details around the scenario.
574;you never know who is interviewing you
575;
576;"There is too much of a negative stigma associated with ""not being able to handle the stress"" of work.  Especially if you are in a startup."
577;Depends.
578;I'm a private person in general, I may not bring it up.
579;"I am a gifted adult and most employers aren't familiar with my differences. People with high IQ can appear intimidating or aloof; mental health issues might be the nail in the coffin"
580;Because I want the job.
581;Potential negative impact on job.
582;Same as above
583;"Strongly advised by mentors not to discuss it; issues with anxiety are often perceived as a weakness/hindrance/liability, even if the interviewer is considerate of mental health issues this can introduce a negative bias."
584;Having occasional depression myself, I'm well-versed in the potential negative (work-related) effects (e.g. trouble focusing, potential for oversleeping, etc.). If I knew the employer was looking for an employee upon whom a lot of responsibilities would be entrusted, I would probably not discuss my depression.
585;
586;Depends on likely impact on work performance.
587;
588;Adds nothing of value to the interview
589;to give them option to choose or reject me, as a whole 
590;
591;My mental health is currently well controlled so no one would know if I didn't tell them.
592;
593;It's good to know about potential hurdles ahead of time.
594;Afraid it would affect outcome
595;Depends on how much social stigma it has. Saying you have ADD is easier thsn, say, depression
596;
597;I believe it would prevent me from getting the job
598;"It's a rather private manner, which one might not wish to share with everyone if they are in a position where you may not be a part of their team any way.

If an interview succeeds should in most cases not be based on any lingering mental state, and as such one would open up and become vulnerable in a negative way."
599;
600;
601;
602;Depends on wether I feel comfortable enough during the interview or when they bring it up in a non-threatening way.
603;Important to bring them up so that all parties are aware.  Hiding a Mental Health issue would never end well for either party.  All conversation should be open and all cards on the table.
604;no need to do so
605;Same as above
606;Same thing
607;It would be seen as a roadblock to productivity and communication.
608;
609;Any perceived issue could affect hirability, anti-discrimination policy or no. 
610;If I feel it won't impact my job, I won't bring it up.
611;
612;
613;
614;
615;I will bring up because it is the main process of body
616;I am at the point in my life where my mental health needs to be part of the conversation. If a company cannot even start to have that conversation with me, then how can I possibly be confident that they will be able to support me when I need to address mental health issues that come up.
617;I *definitely* would be afraid I'd be d/q'd from the job for mentioning this.
618;
619;Same reason as physical. 
620;"Everyone's got shit to deal with. I'm there to interview technically and figure out if it'd be a good fit. I'll ask questions and see what their stance is.

I wouldn't tell someone one a first date that I'm depressed or have bad knees, plenty of other more positive and more interesting topics to talk about."
621;
622;I would feel immediately stigmatized and that my candidacy would be dismissed.
623;Nonstarter
624;Fear of stigma and being considered incompetent 
625;
626;
627;Would be worried about negative stereotypes/affecting the interviewers decision.
628;i would be afraid of bias in their decision making
629;"I would definitely think it would affect my chances of getting that job. I feel like there is a good chance it would not be viewed as ""professional"" to bring it up -- I have been penalized in interviews for bringing up semi-personal information before (was going through the end of a 5+ year relationship and in the process of moving. Disclosed that to a potential employer, found out from the recruiter that it was not viewed as ""professional."")"
630;
631;There's not enough knowledge out there. A physical health problem seems like a fixed risk that can be accommodated. Mental health I'd invisible, therefor an unknown risk.
632;
633;It would depend on whether the issue was relevant to the work being performed and if it will negatively effect it.
634;It depends on the type and severity of the issue
635;more stigma
636;I never surprise my boss
637;Afraid of prejudice, but feel the need to be honest if it limits my abilities.
638;
639;It might impact me negatively.
640;honesty
641;Stigma
642;
643;People have so much stigma and I don't want to find out what kind, I want to get hired
644;
645;
646;
647;
648;
649;Not if I wanted to get hired!
650;because it would kill my chances at the job
651;Same
652;Again, I wouldn't want mental health issues to affect hiring decisions with respect to me.
653;
654;I feel like mental health issues (at least in my state of Pennsylvania) have little or poorly administered protection in the workplace.
655;These would be more likely to directly effect my work I think
656;Despite the legal protections, mental health in my area still suffers a significant amount stigma.
657;As a matter of privacy.
658;I don't want to add any cause for bias until the hiring has been decided one way or another.
659;
660;
661;I have done before. I have no issue talking about it.
662;
663;It may unconsciously affect their decision.
664;Getting the job would be more important in the short term#
665;Same as physical: I would want a potential employer to understand the manifestations of my mental health issues up front to prevent misunderstandings.
666;Because you wouldn't get hired or were docked in pay
667;Wouldn't want to jeopardize my chances. 
668;They don't know me well enough to understand the full context behind any issues. 
669;same reason as above
670;I don't want it to reflect negatively on my ability to carry out my responsibilities
671;I think they would be less likely to make an offer.
672;To ensure that my mental health issues would be accomodated, but it would depend on what the mental health issues I had were
673;"I'm pretty sure that would eliminate me as a candidate. or it would trigger a bias in even the most well intentioned hiring team. it would make them suspicious of me and my technical abilities. finally, there is an ugly history of conflating mental illness with hysteria, or being ""too emotional"", I would be afraid that this would trigger certain stereotypes to surface "
674;
675;I've directly witnessed people terminated for issues related to mental health issues before. Unless required by law or an ethical issue (like a pre-interview agreement), I wouldn't disclose any mental issues. I realize that this is not the best point of view, and it's why things like OSMI are so important.
676;I believe it would result in not being hired.
677;
678;I wouldn't want stigma or prescribed ideas of what I can/can't do to affect my chances of getting hired.
679;I feel like that would negatively affect my employment opportunities.
680;It's not relevant.
681;Leading with a mental health issue seems like it is immediately going to be seen as far more severe, problematic, etc.
682;Fear it would be held against me.
683;I think it would definitely lead to not being hired.
684;
685;Just one more thing to filter me out
686;There is a stigma surrounding mental health issues.  I must trust someone before sharing that info.
687;It would depend on the job expectations, culture, and expectations.
688;not gonna risk that !
689;
690;because I can't control their reaction and unlike physical disorders which are better understood metal disorders are often less understood and judged more 
691;
692;Same reason as physical
693;
694;I have a difficult enough time with my physical disabilities. Opening up my mental health issues at that time would serve no purpose
695;
696;currently no reason to
697;Because it can affect the business, me and him if i am in bad mode.
698;If my prospective job was high stress or could trigger anxiety
699;
700;Wouldn't get the job.
701;It would be a negative in the hiring process.
702;I believe it would severely hinder your chances of getting a job
703;
704;Yes, this shit can crack my workflow, you know? 
705;
706;
707;
708;I would bring it up if during the interview I think such issue may influence my performance.
709;
710;Immediate dismissal
711;I probably would, if it had the same effect as my disability. If not, I can't say how I would act.
712;Because It makes me vulnerable
713;I would only bring it up if I felt it was going to negatively impact my work. If I knew it was, then it would only be fair to share it up front.
714;
715;Depends on the mental health issue and how I feel about the interviewer.  But just like a physical issue, if it's going to affect my employment, the employer should know about it up front. 
716;Fear of not getting the job
717;It depends on how the interview is going, and how the condition may/may not affect the role.
718;Again, it has nothing to do with the ability to perform my role. I am not my mental illness.
719;Depression, burn out and related issues often need attention. I wouldn't work for someone who didn't respect that.
720;Same thing, lower chances of getting the job and fear that they would zone in on that rather than all the awesomeness I can bring 
721;Well of course the employer doesn't want to hire people with significant physical health issues, especially if it's the first issue which comes up. On the other hand I would be comfortable putting in specific conditions for hours (time or amount) which I require for my own mental health. I'm looking for employment, not a psychological counsellor when I see work.
722;I do not think that they would understand, and it would affect their decision. 
723;
724;I feel like they'd not hire me because of it. They'd come up with some BS excuse but I'd suspect it'd be because of the mental health issue.
725;I feel like it would prevent my future employment
726;To avoid stigma.
727;Not sure how I'd feel about. I haven't had one
728;
729;
730;If I was desperate for the job, I would not want to jeopardize my candidacy. On the other hand, if the health issue was very serious and could interfere with the responsibilities of the position, I feel that the employer should probably know about it.
731;
732;more personal issue, afraid of looking like an excuse (see: why don't you just smile more?)
733;Would be concerned I wouldn't be considered for the position.
734;It would be considered strange. I am already a minority, I don't need more negative things counted against me in an interview. 
735;I am bi-polar. For many people, their only understanding of bi-polar is the mass shooter on the nightly news. That is so far from the reality of most bi-polar people that it's like saying because you drive a car you must be a drunk driver.
736;Same as before, it would really depend on the circumstances.
737;
738;
740;It's also relevant
741;Would just depend on the relevance to the discussion.  I wouldn't bring it up unless necessary.
742;If it meant that I needed a flex schedule or similar accomodation
743;I probably wouldn't, depending on what the hypothetical mental health issue is.
744;Feel like they would potentially not hire because of mental health issues
745;It would depend on the type of MH iddue.
746;might not get the job
747;depends on the person
748;I would be discriminated against.
749;Employers look for ways to disqualify you. And even in our lovely web industry, we don not give one shit about employees beyond what we can extract from them.
750;I'm almost certain it'd count against me at interview stage.
751;trust - if I trusted the employer and needed their help I would bring it up. 
752;Same as for physical health, but mental health has more stigma attached to it.
753;There is no doubt in my mind that mental health issues are viewed negatively by those looking to hire in a competitive industry. 
754;I don't have OCD but I'm little obsessive with things and I'm pretty open about it.
755;I don't trust my employer with that information.
756;Na
757;Same reasons as physical
758;I have personally experienced negative treatment after disclosing mental illness.  I want to avoid doing so ever again.
759;
760;
761;Mental health feels more subjective in some cases despite potentially having a diagnosis and could be viewed as detrimental to culture and performance if someone is say clinically depressed or has an anxiety disorder. Also it feels harder to explain potential absence due to a mental disorder.
762;Disclosing mental illness up front is a good way to know an employer's stance or attitude towards mental illness and would help me decide if employment at that business would be worth it for me
763;Do not want to be discriminated against
764;
765;If they made an offer and the issue would impact them. 
766;I think it would depend on the mental health issue and how I felt it would impact the interview.
767;Mental issues are harder to be discussed with anyone.
768;see above — in this instance, i believe it would be perceived negatively.
769;It shouldn't matter
770;I feel like it would hurt my chances of getting the job. I'm not aware of any laws that protect applicants from discrimination based on mental health as there are with physical health.
771;Although should be protected, not convinced it wouldn't harm my chances.
772;See above note about physical discussion.
773;Again, they have no need to know.
774;They would hold it against you
775;
776;Because why do they need to know.
777;Not topical to hiring
778;Because it's an unfortunate part of who I am.
779;Would not want to bring up anything like this as it could negatively influence hiring decision
780;"There's a still very prominent stigma against mental health and that anyone with a mental illness is ""crazy."" Some people would brush it off and understand that it's just like having asthma—an illness that we have to take medication for and we can live normal lives with it. But some don't understand that."
781;Depends on if it would affect my work
782;
783;Potential discrimination
784;The stigma attached to mental health is still to great, its better, but not there yet IMHO.
785;Depends on the type of mental disorder.
786;I haven't been diagnosed with a mental health issue, but if I were, I think I would only bring it up to people I trusted. Potential employers wouldn't fall into that category.
787;No offer
788;
789;Same answer as above: why on earth would you discuss a weakness?
790;Fear it would negatively bias me
791;It could negatively influence my chances of being hired.
792;
793;
794;Not relevant to my skills
795;Fear of discrimination
796;Physical is more obvious
798;Don't want to be flagged as crazy.
799;I feel like employers are not as understanding of prospective employees who might admit to battling bouts of depression or anxiety.
800;It's private, being treated successfully, and would eliminate the chance of getting the job.
801;Prefer to focus on benefits I bring. 
802;To test how supportive the environment will be.
803;Fear of not getting the job
804;Too personal 
805;
806;It is impossible to talk about mental health issues with people you don't know and trust. You don't know how they will react and in my experience there is never any positive or favourable reaction to discussing mental health issues
807;Would not want to be the reason I did not receive the job
809;Don't trust them not to judge and deny the job.
810;Because I don't think they would hire me then 
812;
813;Private
814;I'd be concerned that if I mentioned my generalised anxiety issues it may lead them to believe that I am not a confident worker (which I almost certainly am). Basically - I'd fear they wouldn't properly understand! A lot of people are incredibly ignorant to anxiety and just end up telling you 'not to worry' about parts of your day to day that may make one feel anxious etc.
815;
816;Because of the stigma around my ability to do my job, cope, etc.
817;It would limit potential for employment - why would they hire someone with mental health issues over a healthy person? It's like being on a football team - would they hire someone injured or someone ready to jump in and play?
818;Hard to say. Probably as would jeapodise job
819;Depends how empathetic the interviewer was. And how certain a job offer already is. Might cause bias unintentionally if raised to early
820;If I was going back, even just part-time, to fulltime employment, I'd want to make sure that at least my minimum requirements are met (eg. no open-plan office and similar nasties). Expecting anything more is .. naive.
821;See above.
822;Fear of bias/negative impact on prospects.
824;
825;
826;Same reason as above
827;Depending on the nature of the health issue, I may feel uncomfortable sharing it with someone I'm not close to.
828;I would bring it up if it affected my ability to do the job. I wouldn't bring it up if it felt irrelevant and wouldn't affect my ability to do the job.
829;Afraid it would cost me the job.
830;
831;Same answer as for physical health issues.
832;Depended on the issue and the employer. 
833;Not sure.
834;to get support
835;Less likely, simply because the general perception and knowledge about mental illnesses is less widely understood. For instance, Adult ADD might be simple to explain, whereas Bipolar II would be a longer discussion and may be avoided in an interview.
836;The same as above.  I would not want my application to be viewed in any poorer light compared to my peers.
837;To avoid being disqualified due to that fact.
838;Still such a stigma there... it's important though... tough call
839;
840;Because it is not visible and an employer would look on it negatively. 
841;same reason
842;Would alter the outcome of the interview.
843;I don't believe that it would impact the interview anyway positive, but could have very negative impacts.
844;Potentially affects my capabilities on the job.
845;Worried it would affect my chances of getting the job.
846;Same reason as above basically. Except the added  knowledge of how society views people with depression and anxiety and how that portrayal could reflect on me and affect my chances of getting a job I'm qualified for.
847;
848;I want to be viewed as someone they can rely on and who is emotionally strong, even though that might not be the case.
849;I am currently an opiate addict and will be for as long as I live. I have not used in 3 years. It still messes with me to this day. I do not think I would ever be comfortable sharing that with an employer. Its not documented anywhere that I am an addict so there would be no reason to share such a thing to an employer. Most people do not realize that I have something wrong with my brain chemistry not that I am a terrible person or want to be this way. I do great work and I have had my current job for 6 years. But I feel like if I told any employer that I would be discriminated against or eventually let go.
850;
851;I think it would negatively impact the interview.
852;Depends on relevance to performance
853;"Of fear of being regarded as weak or unable to perform job tasks. Requiring time off for ""fake"" reasons. "
854;"In my experience, many people see mental health as a lesser issue than physical health, and one that can fixed if they ""man up"" or grow up. I worry that mentioning a chronic mental health issue would be viewed as a detriment and a weakness to my work."
855;It may affect my being hired
856;I believe the bias against mental health issues is too strong. And it DOES effect my performance. It's why I freelance.
857;wouldn't want the stigma
858;
859;Seems more private than a physical issue.
860;That would be job suicide.
861;The stigma makes me wary of bringing up mental health issues during an initial interview. I feel like the more I get to know a job and it's people, that determines how comfortable I am with being open about my mental health. I feel like it's too risky to bring up in an interview where both parties don't know one another well enough. I have anxiety and depression, which can also include focus/motivation issues. I feel like mentioning things like this would give the impression that I'm not a good employee who can get things done. However that's not true. I am very responsible and will meet deadlines so long as I can work when I'm most productive and there are flexible schedules.
862;I feel it's best to be candid in an interview, however mental health issues are still a stigma — I'd likely play it by ear and balance the decision of whether to bring it up during an interview based on the tone and thoroughness of the interview.
863;A negative count against me for the job
864;I feel like it would effect my chances of getting a job. It's also none of their business unless it effects my performance.
865;
866;
867;Mental health issues are stigmatized.
868;I would only discuss my mental health issues with a person after I have established that I can trust them.  I also want to show that it will not affect my job performance before I reveal any sort of personal issues.
869;To avoid the stigma that it brings.
870;afraid of stigma, being seen as less capable
871;Haven't thought it through 
872;I would want to steer away from this as stress is the common denominator in all jobs and stress triggers panic and potentially depression. I've had employers bail and then the family who I was supporting as well. 
873;Depends on the level of commitment I'm considering with such an interviewer.
874;
875;Bad experience before, I need to trust the new people to open myself
876;Medical privacy 
878;Same as physical: I don't feel that it is their business and although they should not take it into consideration when hiring, let's be honest, they do.
880;There is still a stigma around mental health issues. The interviewer's perception of my skills and capability to perform the required tasks of the role may be altered because of this (even though I wouldn't have the job yet).
881;That's private information asked none of their business.
882;This would be more difficult because I think people do not understand and are more biased against mental health issues than physical ones, and I'd be concerned they'd find another pretext for not hiring me.
883;
884;not sure - you usually don't know the ppl interviewing you 
885;I would bring it up only if I would need accommodations in order to do my job.
886;See above. Also, it's analogous to bringing up my black wife or gay son.
888;"There's too little understanding or sympathy around mental health. I'd be labeled ""crazy,"" and that'd be the end of the interview."
889;I am a veteran with PTSD-related issues. I believe in total transparency. If it's not appreciated, then I know the potential employer is not for me.
890;Idk
891;Same reason as above. But less likely
892;Seems like it would work against me
893;Again: They need to know who they're hiring.
894;
895;fear
896;Same as before.
897;As before.
898;
899;I would not interview for a position where I believed my mental health would be an issue.
900;Interviewers, especially HR people, tend to look for ways to eliminate candidates, rather than perform positive Selection Interviewing methods.
901;same reason as above.
902;Respecting my right to privacy and avoiding any risk of discrimination.
903;They will definitely be biased
904;"I'm not comfortable enough explaining or discussing mental health. I feel that it may ""make it weird"" in the interview."
905;Because I try not to let it affect my work. 
906;Same reason as before. Add to that the stigma associated with mental health. Not a good idea. I think employers, especially big companies, see mental health issues like depression as undesirable.
907;I don't have a current issue, but I would want to know about health coverage and their general policies.
908;
909;Almost certainty it would impact negatively on getting the position.
910;Trying to get a job
911;It's illegal for that to effect a job offer
912;
913;I am uncomfortable discussing mental health issues outside of my immediate family.
914;Same, I don't want them to think I can't work
915;Not unless I was aware how they felt about mental health.
916;Similarly to physical issues, only if I felt I needed accommodation.
917;
918;Dependant on how comfortable I felt speaking the interviewer(s), dependant if they have mentioned there is an avenue/approach they embrace to address mental health issues. Dependant on how my mental health is that day/week/ etc
919;Same reason, if I felt it would reduce my chance of getting the job and at the same time it would not impede my ability to *do* the job, I wouldn't mention it.
921;fear of discrimination
922;Same as above
923;I'm an honest person.
924;Same reasoning as before.
925;Because it is not an accepted excuse
926;Depends on the health issue
927;Concerned that I would be viewed as unreliable, or a liability.
928;It's embarassing
929;
930;some people view mental illness as weakness. i don't want my employer prejudiced against me on account of my depression.
931;I don't suffer from any mental health issues that warrant discussion - so I'm not sure!
932;The tech field seems highly reliant on mental capabilities. So I would fear that any issues disclosed here might negatively impact my standing (justified or not).
933;Unless I felt comfortable or knew how the employer felt about mental health, I most likely wouldn't feel ready to disclose that information that early on.
934;I am not sure it would hinder my place in the job
935;I would likely perceive that as irrelevant to the interview process.
936;
937;
938;Seems like it would only hurt chances of getting a job.
939;If it affected my ability to do my job
940;Would not get the job
941;
942;As above
943;I cannot explain
944;"The one time I did in the past, the interviewer clearly wrote me off immediately.
Now, I try to judge whether an organization would be a supportive environment without outing myself. It’s a lot easier to ask for accommodation after getting hired and demonstrating the ability to do the job than to give the employer a reason not to hire you in the first place."
945;
947;
948;If I was mentally unstable or unable to work regular hours, I could bias my own interview with this information.
949;Depends if it affects job in anyway. 
950;Don't want to set a bad precedent. 
951;
952;I feel like mental health is a private issue
953;I would rather have our conversation and my qualifications be the focus of an interview.
954;
955;It is not treated with respect
956;Most of employers would refuse to hire me in my opinion. 
957;would certainly mean no job
958;Does not seem beneficial to bring up in interview.
959;I would not want to risk possible discrimination.  Even if it's illegal, it can bias opinions.
960;It isn't a reason they should use to determine if I'm qualified for the job
961;"Not everyone regards mental health as realistic; its kind of an enigma as to treatment options"
962;Would feel it would negatively impact my chances.  So only if it was asked.
963;I'm fairly certain that would influence decisionmaking. There are so many ways to get away with discriminating on that basis, they can just chalk it up to 'cultural fit'
964;I would be afraid that I would be looked-over.
965;Tech industry attitudes such as working long hours expected, peer arrogance, judgemental, etc. present a culture of intolerance, but over the past several years, I have noticed some improvement.  Plus, I'm more of a private person.
966;believe it would be an automatic red flag
967;feel it would negetivly impact my canidacy
968;My employer should be aware of any issues that could reasonably affect my performance
969;It is good to be open
970;Discrimination and not hired
971;Shouldn't generally be relevant
972;Same as physical - would be seen as a negative
973;Nobody's business but my own.
974;Would definitely not be hired
975;As with physical issues, I don't feel like it is any of their business if it doesn't impact my ability to work.  However, mental health issues don't always confine themselves to certain areas of your life, and can spill over.  I feel like if I was in need of a job I would leave out mental issues because they could represent the tipping point between choosing me and another equally qualified candidate.
976;Depends on the issue. It may not be relevant or might not require their support. If it was pertinent, I probably would.
977;Stigma
978;Risk not getting position
979;I think this also depends on if it would effect my ability to perform the job tasks.
980;I brought it up before a Google interview and they weren't willing to make allowances for it. Disclosing it doesn't seem to yield positive outcomes.
981;
982;Same as above
983;
984;
985;
986;potential negative outcome
987;Doesn't concern them
988;jjjjjj
989;I would bring it up because my mental health issues have made me a stronger person and developer. 
990;Mental health issues are not as easy for healthy individuals to relate to. Because of all the stigma in mental illness I would want a new employer to know me better before learning about my mental illness.
991;Because it might just make me look stupid.
992;It would depend upon if it would have any direct or indirect bearing on my position. If it was applicable, I would bring it up. If not, I'd not bring it up unless prompted, same as a physical issue.
993;
994;
995;
996;It is embarrassing and would probably lose me the job. 
997;To see how they react, plus to allow them to know how to best talk with me.
998;Same as physical health issues.
999;Because I don't want to cause any surprise, and I might need some days off because of it
1000;
1001;Depending on the company's culture I would be afraid that it may come off as a weakness or leave a bad impression.
1002;Risk not getting the job.
1003;
1004;I would not be comfortable appearing in any way vulnerable or give the employer a chance to exercise bias against me
1005;Because it's me. Take it or leave it.
1006;
1007;Although illegal, I wouldn't want a mental health issue to weigh on someones mind when they make the decision whether or not to hire me.
1008;I did for my current job. I didn't want surprises. And I wanted to know if that's a blocker of getting hired. It might become an issue some day so I wanted to be sure they know what they get and that, through their reaction I get a glimpse of what I get
1009;Stigma.
1010;I feel that physical issues can be addressed by the employer (installation of ramps, no prolonged standing, etc), while mental issues are perceived as being strictly the responsibility of the individual.
1011;
1012;It's not relevant to the role and illegal to allow for discrimination based in such things in the UK.
1013;
1014;Too much stigma
1015;I would bring it up if I felt it would impact my ability to do my job.
1016;
1017;it might impact the services they needed to provide
1018;
1019;Again, some of that is protected by law in the US.
1020;Fear it might make the prospective employer uncomfortable with hiring me
1021;Again, not part of the hiring process.
1022;Same as physical. 
1023;If relevant for the job, I would. If not, I wouldn't.
1024;
1025;It would be uncomfortable
1026;Because that is up to them to share 
1027;If it came up, I would. I would not bring it up unprompted.
1028;
1029;"It's roughly equivalent to getting a tattoo on your forehead saying ""don't hire me"""
1030;Possibility that this would have a bearing on doing the job
1031;Not relevant to the interview process.
1032;Mental health issues have a negative stigma. 
1033;Because of the perceptions I think they would have.
1034;Stigma
1035;I wouldn't trust a potential employer not to hold mental health against me. 
1036;Because I'm sure it would mean I didn't get the job 
1037;"there are ways to ""legally"" discriminate. it doesn't take much effort to ""legally"" block a new hire for illegal reasons."
1038;same as with physical issue
1039;
1040;
1041;Prefer to keep this private in case an employer discriminates against me.
1042;Fear of discrimination 
1043;Lose out on job, for a certainty.
1044;
1045;I feel there is to much of a stigma attached to mental health issues to bring them up in an interview
1046;I would be certain that nobody would want to hire someone with a mental health issue. 
1047;
1048;It would make them perceive me as weak or someone who will cost them money from sick days
1049;There's a stigma. 
1050;the same 
1051;Same as physical : shouldn't affect outcome 
1052;Again, unless relevant.
1053;I don't yet know what they'd do with that information
1054;There is no benefit and it's a risk.
1055;I would raise it after I got the job if necessary
1056;Worried about it limiting opportunities, seen as a major negative 
1057;
1058;Stigma
1059;Nobody wants to hire a crazy person
1060;
1061;previous attempts haven't gone well
1062;I feel they would definitely weigh it against me in considering me for the job, whether intentionally/consciously or not.
1063;
1064;More Taboo.
1065;
1066;Don't believe they are equipped to understand. 
1067;I wouldn't expect them to hire me and I would expect them to make it known why they didn't hire me.
1068;
1069;same as above
1070;Stigma of mental illness.
1071;An interview is no place to discuss these kind of problems.  An interview is to sell yourself based on your merits.
1072;Viewed as disqualifying
1073;Fear of not getting the job 
1074;probably depends on atmosphere and attitude of interviewer
1075;It would affect my chance of getting the job
1076;If I do is depending on my trust in the person
1077;Mental issue are still considered a bit of a taboo and I have trouble expressing how I feel. It will greatly depend on how I feel on the moment with the interviewer
1078;"It's... just not done. You're advised against it in college: you're told ""don't bring up anything that might be negative in an interview."""
1079;"Because I think that it would put me as a candidate into the ""too hard basket"". It is much to easy to justify not employing someone on other criteria when the mental illness was actually a significant factor thereby avoiding accusations of discrimination."
1080;Too easy for that to immediately disqualify me in their eyes, without me having any proof of this or recourse.
1081;
1082;It might make me look like a liability 
1083;
1084;People who never struggled with mental health issues are incapable of understanding.
1085;It's important to let people know if aspects of the job are going to be more difficult.
1086;The job market is too competitive.
1087;I feel stable on medication right now. I'd only bring it up after accepting the job, if high anxiety occurs
1088;"I'd have to feel really comfortable with the potential employer (close colleague or friend), and would probably not speak to my depression directly. I would bring up the concept of ""mental health days"" and be my own advocate, however."
1089;I would worry that bringing up a mental health issue would have negative consequences.
1090;"I wouldn't want it to affect my chances of getting the job. I'm already a woman and a person of color; why would I bring up something else that makes me different when ""cultural fit"" is such a big deal in this field?"
1091;Social stigma, lack of protection under the law and difficulties proving discrimination
1092;I would bring it up if I felt the employer was knowledgeable and progressive in their approach to mental health issues, such as understanding and appreciate the many positive attributes an ADHD person brings to the table. I would not bring it up unless I was certain they embraced mental health issues.
1093;If it was obvious and was going to affect my workplace, and if there was a way my employer would find out.  But I wouldn't take the job in the first place if I thought my mental illness would affect my job
1094;Again - unless I think it would affect my ability to do my job it is none of their business.
1095;I'd worry about the stigma.
1096;Not the topic of discussion unless my mental health impaired work directly 
1097;As stated above, employers are hiring your mind.
1098;only if it is impacting my work and I feel like and can trust the employer
1099;
1100;stigma
1101;Depends who the employer is, whether public or private sector
1102;Considering that I'm a marginalized person, that would be too risky
1103;i believe there is a stigma around mental health issues, since they are somewhat mysterious.  So, as uncomfortable as i am about asking for a sick day, or for a physical concession, asking for a mental health concession would absolutely be out of the question for me.
1104;
1105;Same as above
1106;"No idea, that's not something I'd be comfortable dealing with. It's essentially as if I told them I may or may not act like a retard some day, but it ain't my fault, it's XYZ disease's fault. :-)

Not a very good pitch to sell yourself"
1107;Fear they would think I was unstable, a risk, or not all there.
1108;Again, depends if it's going to affect my work.
1109;
1110;Same answer. When someone hears that you have mental health issue they do not want to risk hiring you. People are weird...
1111;I would be more worried that a company would know how to deal with a mental health issue.
1112;
1113;Same answer
1114;I feel a lot less protected when discussing mental health, that protection is non-existent or unclear
1115;Depends on the issue, if it would influence my work I would certainly mention it.
1116;
1117; Personal
1118;"Don't want to get rejected. But want to be fully open, to build trust and don't start a job with any ""secrets"""
1119;This is a conservative area. Employers don't want to hear about someone’s “drama”, or risk having that be exposed to a paying client. It might impair the bottom-line.
1120;
1121;It would certainly affect the outcome of the interview.
1122;They would assume lots of things, it takes a lot of education to describe the effects of a mental illness, and requires nuance to interpret how it affects a candidates ability to do a job.
1123;I would bring up a mental health issue in an interview if it affected my ability to work, healthcare coverage, or schedule. However, unlike physical health issues, it seems clear that mental health issues are strongly affected by stress -- to that end, I would feel comfortable asking about the working conditions of the workplace are such that they actively promote finding the most optimum balance between stress and productivity.
1124;"No because I don't feel comfortable discussing it probably because they're (mental illnesses) are not as ""accepted""."
1125;Too much stigma, no way I would get the job.
1126;Concerned would not get the job
1127;Fear of implicit bias against me.
1128;I would definitely be worried that it would significantly hurt my chances of getting hired.
1129;I wouldn't get the job
1130;Too afraid of doing so.
1131;I think they would question whether I could perform the job as well as a candidate without mental health issues.
1132;This seems like it would be disqualifying myself or bringing up trouble that my employer likely wouldn't want to deal with. 
1133;May treat me differently or not hire me
1134;
1135;I work in IT and i might know that my illness has positives my employer is mostly likely ignorant enough to not understand both sides of it. i usually talk about it in a strength versus weakness thing. 
1136;Why give an employer a reason not to choose you?
1137;I would be too afraid they wouldn't hire me if I told them.
1138;
1139;
1140;"Because they would boot my ""crazy"" ass right out of there."
1141;i am not obligated to
1142;Stigma. 
1143;Interviewers may not be trained on how to respond to this.
1144;I would be concerned about how it may affect their decision making. I suppose I shouldn't be as I wouldn't want a job with anyone who let it affect that, but still, I feel mental health issues carry a stigma that many physical ones do not (though I do feel for those with psoriasis and other physical conditions as I am sure they see real stigma from closed-minded individuals).
1145;the large stigma against people with mental health issues
1146;Comfort discussing personal issues with someone who I've presumably only recently met.
1147;May bias employer against me.
1148;
1149;if not current, then feel it's not relevant.
1150;Same as above. My desire for the job may trump my willingness to disclose a potential issue. 
1151;I would not expect the employer to hire me if I were to bring up such a topic in an interview.
1152;It depends on the employer, I think being open about mental health issues with some companies would be good to help find out what their policies are, I wouldn't want to end up at a place with crappy policies for mental health care
1153;There is a stigma associated with mental health issues, at least with some. It is a difficult thing to be transparent about.
1154;
1155;Same as physical...unless it was directly related to part of the job
1156;They would not hire me.
1157;Less likely to get the job.
1158;Would likely negatively affect selection status.
1159;I might not bring up a mental health issue if it did not have any affect on my current work.
1160;That would be a one way ticket out from consideration.
1161;I am privileged to be choosy with employment and would not want to work where bringing up such issues is problematic.
1162;It seems obvious: when trying to get a job you are trying to put your best foot forward and admitting you have a mental health issue or physical health issue makes you look less desirable as an employee
1163;Retaliation
1164;If a prospective employer is unable to answer questions about their mental health services then you probably don't want to work there. That said, I acknowledge that that's a fairly privileged position to take and many people don't have that choice.
1165;I think it would very much decrease my likelihood of getting hired.
1166;"When asked about ""weaknesses"" I am open about my anxiety and what I'm doing to work on it"
1167;
1168;I believe it would negatively influence their decision on whether to hire me or not
1169;I wouldn't get the job.
1170;
1171;Would depend on issue.
1173;
1174;
1175;The mental health issue itself, no, because alone it isn't relevant.  The work I had to do to overcome the issue, yes.
1176;I don't have official diagnosis but I'll maybe get one later
1177;Taboo subject
1178;
1179;
1180;Tolerance and understanding
1181;"Majority of mental health issues, such as depression, bipolar disorder, OCD, schizophrenia are considered a disability. I am afraid that employers might discriminate against what they called ""disabled"" people. I don't even feel comfortable telling my family and friends about my mental health issues.  "
1182;I would not want to bring up anything that could  negatively impact my interview
1183;Non of his/her business
1184;
1185;
1186;
1187;It depends on if I thought the issues would impact my ability to get a job I desired.
1188;Stigma
1189;I feel like all things being equal, a potential employer will always choose a candidate without mental health issues.
1190;Rather keep it hidden, and come forward later once they had come to know me
1191;I assume they wouldn't hire someone whose primary method of work has some kind of issue.
1192;Bias
1193;See my answer above. I don't want to risk a possible position or cast a pall over the rapport with a potential coworker. I didn't always feel this way, but at my last position I got strongly warned, in secret, never to say anything about my condition because people would think I was 'crazy' and 'might shoot up the place.' I have major clinical depression that I've managed and treated for years. The only person it's hurt is myself. But that was the perception of anyone with a mental illness, never mind that they're as wide a spectrum as physical illnesses. So I never said anything. 
1194;People have strong stigmas against mental health issues. Instead I talk about work/life balance and burnout in the tech industry, to get a feel for how understanding they are. 
1195;I would be worried it would be seen as a pity play, make me seem unlikeable/'crazy'/a liability rather than an asset.
1196;Employers don't typically make accommodations for mental health, so no point in bringing it up
1197;
1198;I'd fear they would think it would affect productivity. And if there are many more candidates I could easily be eliminated.
1199;I feel it might color the opinion of everything I said or did.
1200;
1201;
1202;if I felt they would understand I would, otherwise I wouldn't for fear of being discriminated against
1203;
1204;Bit knowing the environment if the new employer would make me nervous to do so
1205;Stigma
1206;They might think I am unstable or unreliable
1207;Because of the stigma involved. I don't want them to think that I would not be able to do my job regardless of my physical condition.
1208;Risk of not getting hired.
1209;In case it affected how well they though I could do the job/reliability
1210;I don't have one
1211;Same reasoning as above, but with more nuance: Software engineers are hired in part because of their intelligence and apparent mental fitness. To undermine their confidence in your ability to perform cognitively out of the gate would, in my experience, lead to the other candidates being selected even if they performed worse in the interview.
1212;
1213;Would feel it could affect outcome.
1214;never. you have no background info about the person who is interviewing you and their understanding of mental health.
1215;Only if working for the disability community.
1216;No good
1217;it depends on whether the issue might be perceived as having more impact on my performance than it actually does, and whether i am confident i can explain the impact and work around it.
1218;"This is the same as disclosing a physical illness, but much more severe; people associate instability with mental health with instability at work, and want only a perfect neurotypical programmer who will be low risk"
1219;Fear of not getting the job
1220;
1221;If that mental heath issue were not germane to the work, I would not bring it up.
1222;
1223;Same answer - I want to know how a potential employer would react before I consider working for them.  
1224;They don't need to know unless/until it affects my work.
1225;I would be very concerned about potential negative bias.
1226;Due to lack of understanding, without bias, how a treated mental health issue could effect work.
1227;It would depend on whether or not I could trust the employer to not stigmatise me as well as how desperately I needed or wanted the job. I can cover my illness fairly well and wouldn't want to harm my chances of getting the job, if necessary.
1228;That would be career suicide
1229;
1230;Not being sure about privacy and consequences
1231;If it was going to affect the ability to do my job, I would feel obligated to let them know.
1232;
1233;"You never know. And the last thing you want in an interview is an armchair psychologist telling you ""you just need to try harder"""
1234;Mental health stigmas mean that I feel uncomfortable discussing mental issues up front
1235;Stigma. Fear of not getting the job. 
1236;Seems like TMI, and I don't want any doubts about my effectiveness as an employee.
1237;
1238;I'd be worried it would bias them against hiring me.
1239;
1240;stigma
1241;Depends on the acuteness of the problem 
1242;Prejudice 
1243;
1244;Unsure of how they woud react.
1245;
1246;Same as above,
1247;It depends on which aspect of mental health we're talking about :) Some are more stigmatized than others.
1248;Only if the job was for an organization or business run by or for people with similar issues.
1249;
1250;it depends. my current job, i made an offhand reference to my therapist in the cover letter. but i also believed myself woefully underqualified at the time so I can't vouch for having taken the application completely seriously.
1251;Same answer as physical
1252;Same answer. But it would feel more raw and vulnerable. Having been self-employed now, I'd be a lot more selective about where I choose to interview, and opt myself out of places that wouldn't be empathetic and understanding.
1253;Bit more taboo about mental health issues. At my last interview I did mention that I only worked well with interesting tasks (let's call it a light case of ADHD), but I did not problematize it.
1255;Your not get the Job
1256;I feel I need to be able to physically and mentally do the job demands to be considered.
1257;Bad experience
1258;
1259;Because I wouldn't get the job.
1260;
1261;If it required me to I would, otherwise id try to keep it to myself. Dont want to be a burden or be labeled as somewhat disabled
1262;Don't want to give someone even just one reason not to hire me. Getting a job is hard enough.
1263;
1264;Same as above.
1265;Because true or not, in my mind I would be taking myself out of the running for the position.
1266;I wouldn't unless it was an obvious issue. 
1267;denial of job
1268;I don't feel like it's relevant to getting hired
1269;I feel it could have a bearing on if I got an offer of employment even though it is illegal to discriminate based on mental health issues. 
1270;Definitely not, because I wouldn't want them to discount my ability to do the job well and mental health has much more stigma around it than a physical problem.
1271;
1272;I don't see it as being relevent
1273;"Telling  someone that's interviewing me that I have clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, autism spectrum disorder, and ADD would bring a lot of stigma. I doubt they'd think I could handle the job, or they'd think I couldn't work well on a team. 

The trust hasn't been built yet. Maybe if the company was really upfront about caring about mental illness, and had people in leadership with mental illnesses, then I'd probably feel comfortable speaking about them during the interview."
1274;Same reason
1275;I would consider it something private that I would manage privately.
1276;It's unlikely to be any of the prospective employer's business or to affect my performance as an employee.
1277;So while this could definitely directly impact my ability to do the job, I would be really afraid to mention it to interviewers. I'm sure there are situations where i might mention it, but in the abstract, I wouldn't bring it up (my mental image of interviewers is kinda veering toward matrix looking fellas in suits)
1278;
1279;
1280;Based on my current employer. They would just see as a reason to take leave or that they cannot push you to the limits it companies like to do for little thanks.
1281;I would only do this if necessary, if it was an obvious mental health issue, if I appeared normal I would not bring it up.
1282;
1283;Fear of failing the interview
1284;If they don't have to know, there's no possible way it can impact their hiring decision
1285;Because it may have some significant impact on my performance if I am not accomodated accordingly.
1286;
1287;
1288;I believe it would impact me negatively
1289;Same as the physical. If it would impact my performance, it's only fair to be honest about it.
1290;I would be concerned that it would affect my chance of getting the job.
1291;Would expect not to be hired if honest about mental health issues
1292;Fear of not making it through interview process due to stigma.
1293;I've been on Disability (SSDI) for Bipolar for 6 years now and if I'm ever able to interview again, I'll need to honestly explain the chasm in my resume. I'd also need to seek employment where my disorder can be understood and accepted at the outset.
1294;That is not something I would be open about unless I felt it was safe to do so, and I could not determine that during the short amount of time of an interview.
1295;
1296;Personal issue
1297;see above
1298;Same reason.
1299;Because they need to know in order to provide me with what I need and to better understand my behaviour 
1300;Same as physical
1302;Stigma
1303;The goal is to get hired, not tossed in the bin.
1304;Shows weakness and changes social situation. Interview fails. 
1305;Set expectations appropriately.
1306;I would be worried that the employer would consider the problem a liability
1307;
1308;
1309;Theoretical, since I'm currently fortunate enough to not suffer a mental illness: If the question comes up or I am aware that this would severely deteriorate the future work atmosphere if people don't know in advance.
1310;stigma
1311;Many people still disbelieve that adult ADHD is a thing — if I suspected a  potential employer had problems I might try to suss them out before taking a job.
1312;It is illegal to not hire someone for having a mental disorder, but it is perfectly legal, from what I understand,  to not hire them for indirect effects of their disorder. I would not have gotten my current job if I briught up my mental illnesses. 
1313;It's instantly seen as a weakness, and then also an issue with your own mental state to discuss that weakness.
1314;Without knowing the employer's stance in mental health issues I would be reluctant to do anything that might jeopardize the interview. 
1315;Stigma
1316;I would be afraid they would let me go if they found out about any mental health issues I would have.
1317;I don't know how a potential employer would react, and whether they would feel accommodating a mental health issue would be considered too difficult
1318;Maybe, it's the stigma
1319;If it applied I would consider it
1320;Fear of negative bias *and* no benefit in bringing it up 
1321;
1322;It wouldn't be worth it in case it somehow did impact the hiring process. Again, it's something I'd rather bring up later or not at all.
1323;
1324;
1325;I would first observe and ask questions to get a feel for how open and accepting the company is. 
1326; I don't want to poison the well... people are prejudiced and in denial about their own issues and vulnerabilities I find...I wish I felt differently...
1327;no way.  would never get the job
1328;
1329;
1330;Stigma.
1331;Some people dont take mental health serious and might think I am incapable of doing the job.
1332;Stigma.
1333;Because they probably wouldn't hire me.
1334;I might be reluctant in an interview as there is still a bit of a stigma...
1335;Cos I would really want the job they might get employ someone with mental health issues
1336;
1337;Again relevancy - would it impact my work
1338;It may inhibit my chances of getting the position.
1339;allowing the interviewer full disclosure to make an informed decision
1340;I'd make me look weaker and less apt.
1341;I would fear that I wouldn't get the job because people would see it as a burden that could lead to problems with my employment.
1342;
1343;I wouldn't want to attach a negative stigma to myself
1344;because i'd be scared they dismiss me politely 
1345;It's important for the employer to know about my needs so they can accommodate them.
1346;If it has an effect on my ability to do work, then yes. Otherwise, it's not their business
1347;It might affect my relationship with my co-workers
1348;See above
1349;I think it would put me at risk of not getting the job.
1350;"It might reflect poorly on me as a candidate; all else being equal, it seems that an employer would want to hire a worker with no chronic mental health problems than one with chronic mental health problems."
1351;Bias/stigma
1352;Same Answer, an employer deserves to know your limitations.
1353;Employers don't offer jobs to people with mental health issues due to stigma
1354;For fear of losing the job.
1355;Fear of negative impact on prospects of employment.
1356;
1357;
1358;Some employers may be open to it, others are not.
1359;It may affect how I work but the employer may not take it seriously depending on the illness
1360;Risk of a negative reaction
1361;
1362;Risk of discrimination
1363;There is a stigma surrounding mental health that you are unstable as an employee if you have mental health issues.
1364;I lost a job because of my mental health issues, it would look bad.
1365;"I feel that mental health issues are still viewed as ""taboo"" and most employers / interviews may not be able to respond to these issues. Talking about it will simply make the interview awkward - and negatively affect my chance to get the job."
1366;This would never help me get a job, and it could only be used against me negatively.
1367;If the employer had a clear, positive stance on the issue, it would be reasonable to talk about. Otherwise it may be perceived negatively because of its intangible, invisible nature. 
1368;Same reason as for physical health issue above.
1369;Same as the above for the physical
1370;
1371;I would be afraid that the entire interview would become a discussion of the issue, and the decision process would be based off whether or not the issue is serious enough to take a chance on.
1372;I wouldn't want them to think less of me.
1373;the stigma of mental illness and how i fear it would impact the job.
1374;Because of stigma.
1375;I feel that it would indefinitely compromise my chance of being hired
1376;There's a definite stigma around mental health issues. It seems like one would be disqualified immediately.
1377;I feel that people are mostly scared about mental disease. I'll be afraid to be classified as crazy and not taken seriously. I would not take that risk.
1378;Same reasons, I'll cost more, be less productive
1379;I don't want it held against me
1380;Worried about not getting a job
1381;Employers are less aware of the legal protections afforded to candidates with mental health issues. I would also fear unstated bias influencing the interview result much more so than I would for a physical issue.
1382;Stigma
1383;If its relevant.
1384;Same as before
1385;Stigma
1386;I'd be worried that I wouldn't get the job.
1387;It would depend on whether the issue could require accommodations.
1388;It creates an expectation of trouble, is difficult to prove and thus has a stigma.
1389;See answer to question b
1390;A general lack of understanding or sufficient social norms to appropriately respond to such issues.
1391;"massive stigmatization in the ""cult of smart"""
1392;I feel there is still pervasive stigma around mental health issues which could be used against me.
1393;Again, if it happens in context, maybe. But, again. In the case of something that's supposed to me trying to look my best, talking about a flaw seems unnecessary.
1394;It would harm my career
1395;"hard to imagine it ever going well. all but the most progressive people see mental health issues as less ""real"". better to frame needs (like sleep, nutrition, doctors appointments) as required to protect physical health in some vague way"
1396;
1397;I already had to do this for my current job. I almost didn't get the job. They made me an offer, I told them it would be difficult for me to travel and a few other things, and they almost revoked the offer. The only reason that they didn't revoke it was because I made it clear that there was a mental health issue (so I'm certain they felt legally compelled) which made me extremely uncomfortable and ashamed that they made me do that. I'm still mad about it even though I kind of get it from their standpoint. They even made me turn in a doctor's note that they're keeping on file. It's none of their business and barely impacts my job, but they made a huge deal out of it.
1398;Just seems really personal and I would worry about that affecting the out come. Not everyone is aware of how that issue would affect someone's work. Or how it could. Not every company has good policies around keeping up to date on how an employee is doing. 
1399;
1400;Same reasons as above, but amplified.
1401;
1402;I'd explain too explicit which would deem me unproductive in their eyes. It would be better to choose a more stabe individual. 
1403;
1404;Stigma. Fear. Typical reasons mental health isn't discussed or divulged. I'd rather not have someone's opinion of me shaped by a disease.
1405;I'd be afraid that it would affect the outcome
1406;I wouldn't get the job
1407;I fear it would have negative consequences. 
1408;Weakens my negotiation position.
1409;Same reason as above.
1410;"Risk of being discarded at a job interview.
Risk of being neglected for a promotion.
Risk of being fired."
1411;It might be considered a sign of being incompetent or incapable of handling the job
1412;risk of job security
1413;I would not bring up a mental health issue in an interview because I would not want it to negatively affect the hiring decision. It is something that I am open about with employers, especially when I need care or personal days, but not something I would bring attention to during an interview.
1414;Stigma
1415;I would worry that they would not want to hire me because of it. 
1416;
1417;Might reduce my chances of getting hired, even though I don't expect them to ever officially name it as a reason for my application being turned down.
1418;I might bring it up because I value honesty and wouldn't want to be employed under false pretences . However I think that a mental health issue would seriously jeapordise my chances of employment in the tech industry.
1419;Depends on the health issue. A mental health issue may prevent a clearance from being issued. It is a risky option to hire someone then have to let them go if they can't get a security clearance.
1420;Fear
1421;duh...
1422;Mental health too stigmatized, don't know the prospective employer well enough to determine whether it would be negative (and it usually is) 
1423;I don't think it's very transparent to many employers how mental health issues might affect a person's workplace efficacy, and I wouldn't want to lose a potential position because of that thought (whether or not the interviewer made that decision consciously or not).
1424;"Again, only if they asked me directly would I discuss my anxiety. 
I wouldn't want them to think that I would be worse at the job than someone else because of it"
1425;Stigma.
1426;
1427;I would be certain it would reflect poorly on me.
1428;As previously stated, my health information is personal 
1429;E
1430;Fear that the employer would consider additional health insurance expense and would doubt my ability to execute my work.
1431;Feels like I'm making a mountain out of a molehill
1432;
